      of the place, the get-up-and-go-to-workness. I've enjoyed
      this in the few places overseas in which I've lived for
      extended periods: Aix-en-Provence, London, Rostov-on-Don. I
      feel it, usually, when the weather is untouristy brisk, when
      people are wearing jackets, dressed in darks, commuting. On
      one street, in Rome, with cars, coming around a curve -- and

      of whom have had the benefit of large, inescapable defeats --

      selfless kind of master? (Wiser and less arrogant than that

      so many villages to be torched in the last half of the
      twentieth century? (Or even a new crusading, albeit Godless,

      certainties -- been surrendered? Or just adjusted? Am I
      underplaying the EU's free-market strictures, its

      imperfect, unwise, inefficient and, alas, unfair (in huge and
      crucial ways) free-market, global capitalism . It just might
      work because it shares important qualities with that other
      <i>pensee unique</i>, democracy. The thing is the
      flexibility, regularity, regular purgings, ostensible
      fairness (in some ways) and stability of the system. I've met
      a lot of poor people on this trip who want someone simply to
      tell them the rules and give them half a chance to succeed by
      them. They want freedom from corruption. They want what they
      don't yet call "transparency." Global, free-market capitalism
      might present as good a set of rules -- at this stage in
      human development -- as any we're capable of

      Is it bad that they're receiving this information? Would it
      be preferable were they more ignorant and therefore more

      necessary to produce a Russian visa, which I didn't have

      to obtain said visa it was necessary to produce train tickets
      from Moscow to Uzbekistan; but you can't buy such tickets

      until Saturday. I know they'll want to see train tickets
      before giving me the visa, but I can't see how I can pay two
      hundred bucks for train tickets before I know whether they
      will get me the visa in time to get on the train. Can't get
      that information by phone. I wait. I ask. Maybe they can do
      it, but I have about a half hour to produce the tickets. Try
