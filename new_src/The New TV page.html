  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  commercial begins with a man in an apron fondling an artichoke
  and discoursing on its nature. Five seconds pass. The camera
  stays with him. Your remote-control finger begins to itch. "This
  is a fresh one, of course," the chef notes. Seven seconds, eight
  seconds. "They also come frozen ..."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Then, just
  when you're about to zap the guy, the following words begin to
  roll across the screen: "One day this may be interesting to you.
  But until that day comes ..." At that moment the screen explodes
  with frantic, often fuzzy images of tumbling, dancing, screaming
  young people -- 13 different shots, none of which last more than
  a second. Flitting between them are the words: "Be Young. Have
  Fun. Drink Pepsi."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This
  commercial, like the others in a recent series prepared by the
  BBDO Worldwide agency for PepsiCo, is ostensibly about the
  virtues of youth vs. age: Pepsi is fawning over the members of
  yet another new generation in a shameless attempt to get its corn
  syrup into their digestive systems. But the commercial has
  another meaning: It is also an attack by the new television on
  the old.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The old
  television, static and talky -- that's what that simulation of a
  cooking show represents. It is the television most serious
  critics of the medium say they want to see more of: Ted Koppel,
  Robert MacNeil, or Alistair Cooke, talking to us, sticking to the
  subject, instructing us about Clinton's economic plan, Victorian
  England or artichokes. It is television for people whose minds
  were formed primarily by another medium: print.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new
  television -- television for people who grew up on television,
  television for people with itchy remote-control fingers -- is
  hyper, disjointed and nonverbal. It cannot be found on PBS or the
  Sunday morning news shows. It got its start in music videos.
  ("Ninety percent of this has to do with MTV," BBDO creative
  director Don Schneider acknowledges.) You can catch glimpses of
  the new television in some action or sports shows -- particularly
  in introductions and promos. But this style of television is now
  most visible in commercials, like that one for Pepsi -- once the
  artichoke chef has been given the hook.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I don't
  think there was ever a conscious attempt to say this commercial
  compares the old TV to the new," Schneider explains. "But in
  effect that's what it does." Pepsi's goal was, in Schneider's
  words, "to reclaim youth" -- and the new TV is the television of
  the young. It is also likely to be the television of the
  future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Every new
  medium seems to have begun by imitating older, more familiar
  media. This was true of print: The earliest printed books, with
  their illuminations and fancy letterings, were designed to look
  like handwritten manuscripts. And it has been true of television:
  The TV formats that are most familiar to us began as imitations
  of radio or theater or film. It takes time for a medium to
  develop new forms of its own. The first novels and the first
  printed newspapers did not appear for a century and a half after
  the invention of the printing press. In that Pepsi commercial,
  and in its cousins, we are seeing some of the first formats
  original to television.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider,
  for another example, a commercial for the Sega video game system.
  This ad is only 30 seconds long, yet it manages to hurl at the
  viewer 48 different images, including: a roller coaster, a
  rocket, a fireball, a touchdown, a rock concert, a collapsing
  building, an exploding house, a woman in a bikini (for that part
  of the audience that prefers such sights to house explosions),
  and a couple of dozen scenes from Sega video games themselves.
  That's an average of 1 1/2 images per second, making this perhaps
  the fastest half minute in television and -- what? -- five, 10
  times as fast as anything we are likely to see elsewhere in our
  lives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The makers
  of this Sega commercial, like almost all advertisers and most
  music-video producers, don't have much of interest to say. Their
  message can be boiled down to the usual: "Hot! Sexy!
  Unconventional but fashionable!" (a persistent contradiction).
  "Buy! Buy! Buy!" Nor do they deploy their plethora of images with
  any great intelligence or dexterity. Nevertheless, the feeling
  and the pacing of such commercials, and of the music videos that
  inspired them, is truly original. (The famous shower murder in
  Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" is cut just about this fast, but its
  many shots were all contained within one scene; in these
  commercials, almost every shot creates its own scene.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">While a
  few experimental films have played with techniques this radical,
  they have been seen only by small audiences. In contrast, "these
  commercials are widely distributed and understood," notes Jeffrey
  Goodby, co-chairman of Goodby, Berlin and Silverstein, the agency
  that produced the Sega ad. "They are not just happening in film
  schools."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Another
  new Pepsi commercial uses as its foil a middle-aged professorial
  type sitting in a room piled high with dusty, colorless ...
  books! (You can almost see the "focus groups" these commercials
  were tested on sneering.) Books represent the old order. This is
  television that finally -- almost triumphantly -- seems to be
  escaping their influence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Sure, some
  commercials still make use of that venerable literary device, the
  narrative -- albeit in radically condensed form: A man who has
  lost his legs in combat returns to play basketball; an attempt to
  "deprogram" a Coca-Cola drinker fails; a son is reconnected to
  his mother through the good graces of a telephone company. We
  know by now how narratives work: A scene is set, a conflict
  created; there is a crisis, a resolution. However, many, perhaps
  most, of the more adventurous new commercials employ none of the
  above. They are instead jumbles, like that Sega commercial, or
  hyperkinetic dances, like some of the other new Coke commercials.
  They have begun almost purposefully to shed the vestigial
  remnants of literary devices.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There is a
  telling moment in still another new Pepsi ad. A hip and decidedly
  young man sits in an easy chair on a beach wearing sunglasses. He
  brings his hands to his glasses. We never see him remove them.
  However, when this young man is next seen -- less than a second
  later -- the sunglasses are off. This is a violation of what
  filmmakers call "continuity." Sunglasses can't simply hop off a
  face; traditionally, there had to be some sort of "transition
  shot."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"We used
  to be real nervous about getting a transition shot," Schneider
  recalls. No more. Nowadays, many advertisers no longer worry
  about such things. The idea that events must happen in a logical
  sequence apparently belongs to the old television. (It probably
  harks back to the printed page, where words had no choice but to
  proceed in a straight line, one after another.) An obsession with
  framing shots symmetrically also seems dated, as does the
  compulsion to make sure that everything is in focus or that a
  picture has been held on screen long enough for viewers to figure
  out what is in it. Some images in this series of Pepsi
  commercials are instantaneous blurs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new TV
  also has found a new -- diminished -- role for words. This is a
  development of some consequence. Words have been our primary
  means of communicating information for most of our history as a
  species. Images -- a drawing in a cave, a photograph in a
  newspaper, an illustration in a textbook -- have usually played a
  secondary role. But in the new television the role of words and
  images is being reversed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Now,
  rapidly changing, moving images -- exploding houses and
  undulating, underclad, underage people -- carry most of the
  information. Words are reduced to simply underlining the image --
  "Be young" -- a purpose better accomplished, in many cases, by a
  scream than by a disquisition. A recent Reebok commercial
  interrupts its parade of intrepid athleticism only for terse,
  written expressions of the rules on "Planet Reebok": "No Limits,"
  "No Cupcakes," "No Wimps," etc. So much for prose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Sega
  commercial, typically, uses few spoken words and then only,
  Goodby explains, to change the rhythm, to momentarily "stop" the
  headlong rush of images. Among them is this deathless statement,
  lip-synched by football star Joe Montana: "I forgot what I was
  going to say." The old television encouraged people to chatter
  away. In the new television there is plenty to show but no longer
  much to say.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Is there
  not something frightening about all this? Is human communication
  to be reduced to a series of images of fiery explosions and
  attractive, gyrating people? To injunctions against "wimps"? Can
  we really find intellectual sustenance in such out-of-focus,
  off-center, three-quarter-of-a-second, non-narrative
  blurs?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Well, no.
  Certainly not now, not yet. Pepsi commercials -- no matter how
  fast and clever -- hardly approach the profundity of books (or
  even "MacNeil/Lehrer" segments, for that matter). But the new
  television is still very young. People with higher motives than
  selling sweetened beverages are eventually going to get their
  hands on these forms. Artists will arrive who can squeeze larger
  meanings out of the relationships between their cascading images,
  who can use them to conjure up new ideas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The value
  of the most daring commercials -- no matter how empty-headed they
  seem -- is in the clues they provide to what we can expect from
  the new TV when it matures. Here is a reading of some of those
  clues:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new
  television will be very fast.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  rush of images that ends Pepsi's artichoke commercial, the de
  rigueur woman-in-a-bathing-suit shot (in this case she is
  rotating a Hula-Hoop) seems to stay on the screen an awfully long
  time -- "an eternity," Schneider calls it. Actually, it lasts
  slightly less than a second. The new commercials have altered our
  sense of time: In the land of half-second images, a second now
  seems almost languid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Of course,
  television in general has altered our sense of time. We have been
  trained, in a process that began for the latest Pepsi generation
  with "Sesame Street," to expect the perspective or the scene to
  change every 10 seconds or every five seconds or faster. Older
  documentaries, dramas and commercials, with their 15- or
  20-second cuts, now look slow and boring. And one lesson of these
  recent commercials is that we can expect the pace to grow faster
  still -- throughout television. Those who now bemoan the
  shallowness of the five- or 10-second sound bite in TV newscasts
  will have even shorter sound bites to bemoan soon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">How fast
  can TV become? "The shortest unit you can get on videotape is
  one-thirtieth of a second," Goodby answers, "and the eye can see
  that."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new
  television will have rhythm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">All this
  speed has created new kinds of organizational problems. For
  example, an ad produced by BBDO for General Electric's airplane
  engines shows 77 different images in 60 seconds. They include
  shots of a hockey goalie, a mother kissing a child, a computer
  screen, fast-motion traffic, a group of kids holding up a Sumo
  wrestler and, oh yes, airplanes. Some of the images are sepia in
  tone, some feature bright primary colors; in some the camera
  zooms or shifts focus, in some it remains still; some are
  close-ups, some long shots.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">No
  existing grammar is of any value in organizing these disparate
  images: Viewers don't seem to care if images dangle or disagree.
  Nor are cinematic guidelines of much use: The fastest of these
  commercials waste no time on such things as "reaction shots."
  There are no "cutaways" to someone watching an airplane land. And
  it takes only a few seconds in that GE commercial to break a
  couple of other old cinematic rules, as a camera hurriedly pans
  from right to left across the front of an airplane and then, at a
  similarly dizzying pace, from left to right across its
  wing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  "creatives" at these advertising agencies have only one sure
  guide as they arrange these images: rhythm. The shots in that GE
  commercial come and go to the beat of a peppy, if saccharine,
  ditty listing the many places airplanes with GE engines fly: "St.
  Petersburg and Uruguay and Malibu and Paraguay ..."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Rhythm is
  crucial to these commercials. Even if advertisers get over their
  infatuation with youth and MTV, they will, consequently, still
  lean heavily on music. That ad for airplane engines, it should be
  noted, is certainly not intended for teenagers. The music is
  there, and will continue to be there as the new TV develops,
  because it is needed to help hold everything together. "It just
  works," Schneider comments. "The eye loves film cut to fast,
  heavy rock-and-roll."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new
  television will be casually surrealistic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Some
  strange things have been happening lately in TV commercials: A
  man suffering in the heat opens a beer bottle, and it begins to
  snow. Footballs sail in and out of TV sets. Trucks are
  transformed into race cars. Faces become cubelike in shape or
  merge into one another. The new television easily overcomes such
  trivialities as physical laws: You don't have to convince people,
  as you would in most books (or even in most movies) that there is
  a world where snow might suddenly fall on a hot day; you simply
  show it suddenly falling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Such
  excursions beyond reality should have significant artistic uses.
  Words re-imagine the world primarily through metaphor: One thing
  -- a dawn, say -- is spoken of as if it were another --
  "rosy-fingered." In the new television, one thing can be shown to
  be another. Through this easily available surrealism, the world
  will be subject to new, perhaps even more stimulating,
  re-imaginings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  methods might even have something to contribute to journalism.
  The administration's health care proposals might be illustrated
  by suspending reality for a couple of minutes and showing Hillary
  Rodham Clinton flying through hospitals, adding and subtracting
  patients, changing treatments, tackling paperwork and reaching
  into doctors' wallets. The new TV may not be willing to tarry for
  more than a few seconds over politicians' statements, but it
  might develop ways of explaining that are more powerful than
  simple statements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The new
  television will not limit itself to following a single train of
  thought.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">As our
  eyes have marched along the long, thin lines that are stacked on
  a printed page, they've gotten used to things happening one at a
  time: "They dismounted. Rodolphe tethered the horses. [Emma]
  walked ahead of him on the moss between the cart tracks." That's
  how things proceed most of the time on "Nightline" or
  "Masterpiece Theatre" too. And it leads to a certain kind of
  logic: one-thing-at-a-time logic, if/then, cause/effect logic --
  the logic on which most of us were brought up.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In these
  new television commercials, however, numerous things happen at
  once: Swarms of pictures fly by, there are patches of narration,
  music pounds away, slogans jump out at us. Because so much is
  going on, there is room in these commercials for odd
  juxtapositions, for wild digressions, for effects that seem to
  have no cause at all : A shot of Sadaam Hussein pops up in the
  middle of that Sega commercial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I've
  watched adults watch a Sega commercial," says Goodby. "They ask
  all these logical questions, and they get confused. They want it
  to make more sense than it's really going to make."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  commercials rarely make a simple one-thing-at-a-time sense. There
  is too much room in them for paradox: The last slogan flashed on
  the screen in that "Planet Reebok" ad is "No Slogans." There is
  too much room for irony and for unexpected bursts of
  self-consciousness: One recent Nike commercial, starring Michael
  Jordan and Bugs Bunny, pauses for an instant to place a sign
  reading "Product Shot" next to a picture of the sneakers it is
  hawking -- then it's on to the next incongruous
  moment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"This
  quick cutting really works to our benefit," notes Schneider.
  "We're trying to get a lot of information out there, and this way
  you can get more in." Because it allows "more in," this fast,
  jumpy TV eventually should also work to the benefit of serious
  artists who want to get more profound information "out there."
  Its capaciousness may allow them to cobble together ideas that
  would have been too oddly shaped, too multilayered, too freighted
  with contradictions to fit between the covers of a book. It may
  allow them to invent new ways of making sense.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Certainly
  nothing quite that challenging has shown up on television yet. We
  may not see it anytime soon; perhaps a language of imagery will
  first have to be invented and mastered. But the signs that
  television has the potential to help us say something new are
  already here -- not so much in the programs themselves but in
  these 30- and 60-second spaces between them.</font></p>
