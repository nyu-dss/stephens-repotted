  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A debate
  has been raging in the world of scholars and intellectuals. On
  one side are the "postmodernists" -- the thinkers whose ideas
  inspired the playful, hybrid buildings, outfits and artworks that
  now grace the American landscape; the thinkers who encouraged a
  generation of graduate students to "deconstruct" such
  long-treasured notions as "reason" and "justice."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The major
  figure on the other side of this debate is Jurgen
  Habermas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  is a German philosopher -- "the leading systematic philosopher of
  our time," Richard Rorty of the University of Virginia calls him.
  But Habermas comes to this debate as much more than just a
  philosopher. "In terms of range and depth there is no one close
  to him," says Thomas McCarthy, a professor of humanities and
  philosophy at Northwestern University. "Habermas has been able to
  go into discussions in political theory, in sociology, in
  psychology, in legal theory -- in a dozen different disciplines
  -- and become one of the dominant voices in each one."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  academic world nowadays, such range, depth and dominance attract
  an endless stream of conference invitations. Habermas accepts his
  share. And sometimes at these conferences, particularly if
  Americans are in attendance, he'll find himself surrounded by
  postmodernists. Swords will be raised. The debate will resume.
  The postmodernists might begin questioning, for example, whether
  "reason" isn't just the name the powerful give to their
  rationales for holding power or whether "justice" isn't just an
  excuse for the majority to impose its morality on the minority.
  (One such conference was dominated by legal theorists from
  Harvard Law School.) Habermas, an aficionado of open debate, will
  fight back, enthusiastically, aggressively.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Whether he
  has been a voice of reason and justice is disputed in philosophic
  and political circles, but Habermas certainly has been a staunch
  advocate of the importance of these principles. He believes we
  can reason out solutions to our problems, that just institutions
  can lead to a fairer society. And when irony-wielding
  postmodernists make light of these possibilities, Habermas
  responds with formidable barrages of scholarship and
  logic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This is
  high drama, or at least what passes for that in academia. Feet
  wiggle nervously under chairs. In the audience, students and
  professors furrow their high brows and jot down each deft
  riposte.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">At stake
  in these confrontations is a crucial 20th-Century intellectual
  issue: Are there certain basic standards underlying our behaviors
  -- standards like reason and justice? Or is the world a swampy,
  relativistic place, where we play our games or seek some power in
  the muck? For Habermas, something else is at stake here, too: A
  crucial 20th-Century political issue.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">According
  to a number of those who have watched him at such conferences,
  Habermas sometimes grows exasperated with his cynical
  antagonists. When that happens, he might pull a microphone toward
  himself and suddenly silence the others on the panel by saying
  something like this: "In the United States, you have a
  200-year-old tradition of constitutionalism. You have the luxury
  of questioning those ideals. Where I come from, we
  don't."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Where he
  comes from, Habermas is not just a star academic. For 40 years,
  he has been in the public arena fighting to keep Germany headed
  in the direction of reason, justice and other ideals he now hears
  postmodernists deconstructing. And that fight -- a political
  fight -- goes on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Jurgen
  Habermas, as often happens when he reads the newspaper, was
  agitated. It was 1992, and right-wing attacks on immigrants and
  foreign workers, which had begun in the former East Germany, were
  continuing. "Every week there were reports about another three or
  four incidents," Habermas recalls at his home outside Munich.
  "And as you read the paper every morning, you could not help but
  get more and more angry -- not just at those who did it, but at
  those who played it down, who turned their backs, who worried
  that talking about it would hurt Germany's image in the world.
  And then, when a certain threshold was passed, you couldn't help
  but write an article."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">When
  Habermas writes such an article for a German newspaper, as he
  does three or four times a year, it usually causes a stir. "He's
  a public figure," explains Peter Glotz, a leader of Germany's
  Social Democratic Party. "His writings don't influence masses of
  blue-collar workers, but they are read by a lot of German party
  officials and journalists and so on. In this way he is very
  influential."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  is, in other words, that rare thing: a public intellectual --
  "the most visible of his generation," asserts Northwestern's
  McCarthy. Certainly, no contemporary American scholar has had
  such impact upon political debates. And Habermas' political
  significance would be even greater were it not for an odd quirk:
  He is one of the few public figures today who refuses to go on
  television.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A cleft
  palate gives a slightly asymmetric feel to Habermas' square,
  strong face and has left him with a minor speech impediment.
  Might this be behind his reluctance to appear before the cameras?
  "The pragmatic reason why I refuse these requests is that I have
  to protect the time and rest (I need) for my professional work,"
  he notes. Then Habermas adds, "Maybe there are also reasons of a
  more personal nature."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Print is
  Habermas' medium: Books, of course, and he reads and writes a
  wide variety of them, including many difficult philosophic tomes.
  But not just books. "I need to read a newspaper each morning to
  feel that I'm still participating in the world," the philosopher
  declares. "Reading the newspaper arouses passions." Those
  passions grow most intense when he sees evidence that Germany is
  backsliding.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  was 15 when the Allies defeated Germany in 1945. He had been a
  member of the Hitler Youth and had been sent, during the last
  months of the war, to "man the western defenses." His bourgeois
  father had been a "passive sympathizer" with Nazism. Nazi society
  was the only one the young Habermas had known.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Then the
  Nuremberg war-crimes trials started, and the first documentary
  films on the concentration camps appeared. "All at once we saw
  that we had been living in a politically criminal system,"
  Habermas has explained. His political life began with this
  awakening. It established what he labels the major "motif" of his
  politics: a vigilance against any recurrence of such "politically
  criminal" behavior.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This
  "motif" was in harmony with the beliefs of the "Frankfurt
  School," an extraordinarily distinguished collection of leftist,
  mostly Jewish, philosophers and social thinkers gathered in the
  Institute of Social Research at the University of Frankfurt.
  After the war, when most of its members returned from exile, the
  institute was led by two of the world's foremost intellectuals,
  Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  aggressively interdisciplinary way of thinking that the Frankfurt
  School developed -- "Critical Theory" it was called -- aimed to
  put philosophic ideas to the task of diagnosing social problems.
  There were years when it was difficult to get through college in
  Europe without being drawn into debates about the success of this
  project. Habermas became Adorno's assistant in 1956. He was given
  Horkheimer's chair in 1964. Habermas quickly found his own voice
  as a theorist, but he has never stopped trying to apply
  philosophic ideas to social problems. Indeed, he has had as much
  to say about the perils of intolerance, repression and poverty as
  any other modern philosopher.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  subsequently became a political figure -- and a target. Student
  radicals attacked him in 1968 for being insufficiently
  sympathetic with their tactics. The right derided him and the
  other members of the Frankfurt School in the 1970s as the
  "spiritual fathers of the terrorists." Habermas had denounced
  these young German kidnapers and bombers, but, his critics noted,
  many of them had read his calls for a more free and equal
  society.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  continues to get into squabbles -- with those who sped Germany
  toward reunification (too quickly, in his view); with those who
  want to take apart his country's ambitious system of social
  welfare, and with those he believes to be opponents of open
  debate or proponents of intolerance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In recent
  years, his most visible fight has been with German revisionist
  historians, who attempted, in his words, "to make Auschwitz
  unexceptional" by connecting it to other 20th-Century massacres.
  Habermas labeled their arguments "astonishing" and "transparent"
  as he took them on one by one in a series of newspaper articles.
  Along the way he reminded his readers of "the obligation
  incumbent upon us in Germany -- even if no one else were to feel
  it any longer -- to keep alive, without distortion and not only
  in an intellectual form, the memory of the sufferings of those
  who were murdered by German hands."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Anti-Semitism is a subject on which Habermas has been
  particularly vigilant. "I've never met a non-Jew who is more
  sensitive to these issues -- intellectually and personally," says
  his friend Richard J. Bernstein, a philosophy professor at the
  New School in New York.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The word
  conscience is used frequently, at least by those on the left half
  of the political spectrum, in describing Habermas' role in German
  politics. "He will always stand up and say the right thing at the
  right moment," asserts Anselm Haverkamp, a literature professor
  from Germany who now directs the Poetics Institute at New York
  University. "And he says it without the politicians saying,
  'Well, this is just an idealistic philosopher.' No one would say
  that about Habermas."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">*</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas'
  political ideas, he is happy to acknowledge, are connected to his
  philosophy. But when he is asked to sum up that philosophy, he
  grows quiet for some minutes. "I must say that I hate that
  question," he finally responds, a smile lifting the corners of
  his wispy mustache. "I hate this idea that you have one great
  idea, as (the German philosopher Martin) Heidegger always
  maintained you should."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Of course,
  Habermas has had a large number of good ideas as he has sailed
  from one research area to another. But behind his contributions
  to all these different disciplines there seems to have been one
  central theme: his theory of "communicative action."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">As Seyla
  Benhabib, a professor of political theory at Harvard, explains:
  "Habermas believes human social life rests on our capacity to
  have more or less clear communication with each other." We
  communicate -- to paraphrase Descartes -- therefore our society
  exists.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A rather
  antiquated, idealistic message to be spreading, some might think,
  in a world of abusive talk-show hosts, misogynistic rap groups
  and earphone-encased teen-agers. Habermas is, to be sure, as
  concerned about pop culture as the next philosopher. But he
  continues to believe that somewhere behind the better of our
  attempts to communicate with each other, there have to be some
  shared values, shared respect and acknowledged equality. He sees
  the participants in conversations, in other words, as playing on
  the same teams. And as they talk together, Habermas insists, they
  make an effort to employ reason.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"This may
  not seem like a big deal," Benhabib acknowledges. "But it has
  fundamentally changed our way of thinking about society in the
  last 25 years or so." Habermas' theory, she explains, calls into
  question a belief that is widely held by cynical and fashionable
  thinkers on the right and the left: the belief that human
  behavior should be seen as a battlefield upon which each of us is
  merely out for our own strategic interests. In our "communicative
  actions," the right sees selfish individuals struggling to get a
  leg up on each other; the postmodern left sees the powerful
  exploiting the powerless; but Habermas sees, of all things, a
  kind of cooperation. Indeed, he shares with Socrates an almost
  utopian belief in the wholesomeness of debate and
  discussion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">His
  critics find this view a trifle rosy. Habermas persists, for
  example, in maintaining that "in our everyday knowledge of how
  language is properly used we find a common ground among all
  creatures with a human face." That's called "humanism." That's
  called "universalism." These are beliefs any self-respecting
  postmodernist rejected decades ago. Moreover, Habermas is
  convinced -- and this really gets the postmodernists calling for
  the violins -- that through reasoned communication we humans can
  get beyond our biases.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas'
  many acolytes share this faith. They have been pondering the
  glories of the impulse to communicate in philosophy and exploring
  the roots of that impulse in developmental psychology. They have
  been refashioning political theory and social theory -- to make
  room for more debate and discussion. And, fashionable or not,
  they have had considerable impact. "Habermas is a world figure,
  maybe a planetary figure, in social theory," states sociologist
  Herbert J. Gans of Columbia University.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas'
  formulations have even made their way into a debate about the
  U.S. Constitution. The question, as it always is, is should the
  Constitution referee in tag-team matches between hostile and
  competing interest groups? Or should this document, and the
  government it laid out, serving as a facilitator, encourage
  chummy, reasonable citizens to exchange views and reach a
  consensus? "Habermas' work has been of use for those of us who
  are trying to make sense out of the latter view," says Frank
  Michelman, a professor at Harvard Law School.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Although
  Habermas bristled at the presumption that he has had "one great
  idea," the philosopher is willing, after some meditation, to
  admit to the existence of a "thread" that runs through his work.
  This is it: "I think that a certain form of unrestrained
  communication brings to the fore the deepest force of reason,
  which enables us to overcome egocentric or ethnocentric
  perspectives and reach an expanded . . . view."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This
  thread ties in neatly with the values of the Enlightenment. Those
  of us who have been out of social studies class for a while may
  need to be reminded that the Enlightenment was a struggle, which
  began 200 years ago, in the name of reason, against tyranny,
  superstition and inequity. Voltaire and Thomas Jefferson saw
  themselves as involved in that struggle. Habermas has contributed
  to it, too.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  Enlightenment, you see, left open a crucial question: How does
  reason -- at whose behest so much has been challenged -- justify
  itself? Reason has undercut our belief in the spiritual, in the
  traditional. What is to prevent reason from challenging reason?
  Why, in other words, should we believe in reason? In
  "communicative action," Habermas thinks he has come up with an
  answer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Reason, he
  maintains, is crucial to clear communication. So, to oversimplify
  a little, if we believe in the importance of the universal human
  impulse to communicate, we have to believe in reason. The
  Enlightenment, Habermas concludes, continues to have "a sound
  core."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">*</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Those
  looking for a 20th-Century movement in which to pigeonhole
  Habermas often settle upon "modernism." His sympathy with the
  travails of reason and his fascination with the Enlightenment
  support that classification. So does his house.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It stands,
  rectangular and devoid of decorative flourishes, on a narrow,
  sharply sloping lot in Starnberg, a small lakeside town outside
  Munich. Habermas left Frankfurt for Starnberg in 1971 to become
  co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Research Into
  Conditions of Living in a Scientific and Technological World. He
  and his wife, Ute, then built a spectacular, pure-white,
  Bauhaus-style house, filled with books and light. They were
  inspired by the great Viennese architect Albert Loos -- the
  quintessential modernist.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  returned to the University of Frankfurt 12 years later, but
  between academic sessions, he and Ute, with whom he has reared
  three children, continue to spend most of their time in
  Starnberg. "There's no great reason for them to return there,"
  suggests one colleague. "I think they stay there because of that
  house."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Of course,
  philosophical fashions, like architectural fashions, have changed
  in the last decades of this century. The Enlightenment, many
  contemporary scholars maintain, is over, modernism finished.
  "Habermas is the leading defender of Enlightenment universalism,"
  comments Rorty, probably the best-known American philosopher. "I
  find his attempt very impressive. He does it in a way nobody had
  thought of doing before, but I still don't believe
  it."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  postmodern age, of course, humans aren't seen as having universal
  impulses or sharing a common ground. Postmodernists have no use
  for such generalizations. Human attitudes, they insist, vary as
  much as human cultures do. Japanese see things differently than
  Swedes. Metallica lovers probably see things differently than
  those who fancy Counting Crows. The world, postmodernists
  maintain, is full of egocentric and ethnocentric biases, full of
  complexities. Attempts to squeeze it into smooth, rectangular
  packages -- in philosophy or in architecture -- are futile and
  foolish. In the postmodern age, those who create buildings,
  clothing, novels and world views are encouraged to throw in a
  little of this and a little of that -- without pretending that
  this or that, one perspective or another, is somehow
  correct.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Reason is
  the tool we use to divine what is correct and construct those
  out-of-favor generalizations, so in the postmodern age it is
  particularly suspect. The late French philosopher Michel Foucault
  derided reason as just another instrument of oppression, just
  another weapon on the battlefield. Another French philosopher,
  Jean-Francois Lyotard, who teaches at UC Irvine, has argued that
  the "triumph of reason," which we tend to credit for science or
  democracy or MacNeil-Lehrer, is merely a "narrative" we tell
  ourselves -- a bedtime story for those of us who haven't outgrown
  the belief in progress.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"At the
  finish of this century," contends Lyotard, author of the book
  "The Postmodern Condition," "after the enormous massacres we have
  experienced, no one can any longer believe in progress, in
  consensus, in transcendent values. Habermas presupposes such a
  belief."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Stanley
  Fish, a professor of English and law at Duke University, has been
  particularly critical of Habermas' work. Fish scoffs at the
  notion that we might talk our way past our biases. In order to
  enter into a conversation in which you might lose your
  prejudices, he argues, you'd have to begin by putting aside your
  prejudices. "The trouble with Habermas' way of thinking," Fish
  asserts, "is that you couldn't possibly take this first step.
  This first step is in fact the last step.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I have
  always been mystified by the attention that Habermas receives,"
  Fish says. "His way of thinking about these matters seems to me
  to be obviously faulty. The only way I can explain it to myself
  is that Habermas represents something that a lot of people would
  like to buy into: He seems to offer a way out of corrosive
  relativism."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">If
  Habermas' thoughts provide some resistance to the potentially
  "corrosive" belief that such standards as justice and reason are
  merely "relative," his ideas do not come from some sort of
  stainless idealism. His beloved reason is not a magic sword that
  can instantly slice away all biases. It is, instead, a
  late-20th-Century reason; that means he sees it as fallible, as
  merely the product of imperfect human discussion and debate.
  Habermas doesn't pretend that prejudices can be instantly removed
  or discarded. He does believe, despite what the postmodernists
  say, that reasoned communication can, over time, weaken
  them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">So the
  battle lines have been drawn. Habermas, says Martin Jay, a
  history professor at UC Berkeley, is "a bulwark against some of
  the more problematic strains in postmodern thought." Habermas'
  book "The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity" defends modernism
  against the prefix that presumes to outdate it and criticizes
  various postmodern demigods -- including Foucault and Mr.
  Deconstruction, Jacques Derrida. Rather than going beyond
  modernism, he argues, some of them have just wandered off on some
  of its more "negative" and "empty" byways.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Tough
  criticism. Before Foucault died, he and Habermas had established
  a friendship and a dialogue. Habermas had thought he was on his
  way to building a similar relationship with Derrida. Then he sent
  him a copy of this book. Habermas received a polite thank-you
  note and then never heard from Derrida again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas'
  unfashionable beliefs, particularly his attachment to reason,
  probably can be traced to a deep awareness -- where he comes from
  -- of the horrors of unreason. "When you begin flirting with
  irrationalism and nihilism," explains his friend Bernstein, "for
  him it evokes horrible memories. It evokes the Hitler
  period."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  admits that there is a strong personal element in his thought.
  "Philosophers live finally from their own intuitions," he
  suggests. "And those intuitions are not acquired by reading
  philosophic texts. They are acquired in certain particular
  individual experiences while growing up -- rather negative
  experiences of violation, indignation and Krankung." Habermas'
  English is strong. He has taught at Berkeley, for example, and he
  is teaching at Northwestern University in Chicago this fall.
  However, Habermas can't think of an English translation for this
  German word.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">What early
  experiences might have shaped the philosophy of this man, who
  grew up sensitive, brainy and with a slight impediment in Nazi
  Germany? "I wouldn't like to talk about my own intuitions,"
  Habermas says. "I don't like to talk about that." Krankung, a
  dictionary later reveals, means "insult," "outrage" or
  "mortification."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">*</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Anselm
  Haverkamp recalls having spent the whole day with Habermas at a
  conference in Germany. "It was a typical European conference,"
  the New York University professor says. "It began at 9 in the
  morning and went on for eight or 10 hours." Then there was more
  talking over dinner. At 2 a.m. Haverkamp, exhausted but
  jet-lagged and unable to sleep, went downstairs. "And there was
  Habermas, still talking to a couple of people at the hotel bar.
  He grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me pass, and for yet another
  two hours we continued to discuss difficult problems in political
  philosophy."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas,
  in other words, not only believes in reasoned communication, he
  practices it -- eagerly. Not on every subject, of course. Pockets
  of reticence certainly remain. (Habermas has admitted that he
  failed to confront his father about his behavior during the Nazi
  years.) But, for the most part, he throws himself into debate and
  discussion with passion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Habermas
  is someone who really has to be pulled out of a restaurant at
  midnight," says Gertrud Koch, a German scholar and film critic
  who has spent many evenings with him and a group of professors
  and students at a Greek restaurant in Frankfurt. And the later
  the hour grows, "the more the discussion turns to politics, and
  the more lively it gets," reports Hauke Brunkhorst, a philosophy
  professor who has participated in these sessions. Even the
  waiters and the restaurant's owner sometimes join in.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"It's
  true," Habermas admits, "I love it." His wife, he says, often has
  to remind him that he is teaching the next morning and not to
  stay too late.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">When the
  discussion does turn to politics, Brunkhorst explains, Habermas
  stands, "in American terms, somewhere between a radical and a
  liberal." He votes mostly for Germany's Social Democrats and is
  sympathetic to the Greens, the environmental party. He supports,
  what he calls without flinching, the "welfare state," which has
  come under renewed attack in Germany and elsewhere in Western
  Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The key
  word in Habermas' political vocabulary, however, is democracy. He
  often has in mind a more "radical democracy" than that with which
  most Americans are familiar. "In the phrase 'government by and
  for the people,' Habermas places much more emphasis on the 'by'
  than most of us normally would," McCarthy explains. He wants less
  unthinking nationalism and more reasoned communication on public
  issues. He wants more participation by citizens in government
  processes, in political parties, in economic decisions -- a
  larger "public sphere" than can be found in any existing society.
  He wants more debate and discussion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This
  prescription, too, sounds naive to many allies of the
  postmodernist camp. "It's the liberal answer to everything,"
  asserts Fish. "Let's talk it to death. Habermas preaches the
  theology of talk -- the elevation of philosophy department
  seminars to a mode of public life."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Conservatives find Habermas' political ideas disturbing for
  different reasons. "His work is stimulating, intellectually
  challenging," concedes Wolfgang Pordzik, director of the Konrad
  Adenauer Foundation in Washington, D.C., which is close to
  Germany's Christian Democratic Party. "But Habermas is just dead
  wrong in terms of his political recipe." In the eyes of most of
  those on the other side of the political spectrum, that "recipe"
  includes too much "public" -- which they read as "state" --
  interference in economic matters. It places too much emphasis on
  cooperation, not enough on old-fashioned, reliable
  competition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Nevertheless, Habermas' strategies for increasing the scope
  and power of the "public sphere" have had a significant impact.
  Indeed, they were important to those who were fighting state
  communism in Eastern Europe before 1989. "In Eastern Europe, the
  Communists had crushed all public spaces," notes Jean L. Cohen, a
  political science professor at Columbia University. Habermas
  demonstrated how important forums for public discussion outside
  of government were, and his theories helped dissidents imagine
  how these forums might be used -- as the Solidarity labor
  movement was used -- to oppose the government.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Adam
  Michnik, one of the leaders of Solidarity in Poland, had studied
  Habermas' work while in jail. A large number of Hungarian
  dissidents were also familiar with it. "Habermas' book 'The
  Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere' played an
  extremely important political role in Hungary," explains Anna
  Wessely, a professor of sociology at the Eotvos University in
  Budapest. "It helped to conceptualize the role of the society
  against the state."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In at
  least one Eastern European country, Habermas' impact is spoken of
  in the present tense. Ivan Vejvoda is one of several members of
  the Belgrade Circle, a group of anti-war Serbian intellectuals,
  who say they have been influenced by Habermas' work. "One of the
  main concerns of the Belgrade Circle," Vejvoda says, "is to try
  to broaden the scope of free speech, to create a public space out
  of which we can create the foundation of a democratic culture.
  Habermas' ideas are absolutely not only useful but important in
  this process."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">*</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Opposite
  the bookcases in the living room of Habermas' modern house is a
  wall of windows. It faces west, which is fitting. Over the years,
  Habermas has had one overriding political interest: not Eastern
  Europe, despite all the attention his work has received there,
  but the Federal Republic of Germany. And, over the years,
  Habermas has given himself to one overriding cause: keeping the
  Federal Republic oriented toward Enlightenment values, values
  that have been most at home in the West.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is not
  clear to him that the fall of the Berlin Wall, glorious as it
  was, has helped that cause. Though Habermas is obviously happy
  for the former East Germans, the new, reunited Germany makes him
  nervous. "From the first minute, I argued that we should stress
  republican premises for reunification, not nationalistic
  premises," he notes. As Bernstein points out, "Any smell of
  Germany having a special destiny almost viscerally upsets
  him."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Habermas
  wanted the East Germans to have more time to discuss their own
  future. Now he worries about the resentment against immigrants
  that has been released by the dislocations of reunification. He
  worries, too, that this larger, potentially more powerful Germany
  will stray from the confines of the European Union, form separate
  relationships with its former communist neighbors and assume,
  once again, the role of leader of Central Europe. He worries, in
  other words, that the country in which he lives, which so
  conspicuously lacks a long tradition of constitutionalism, might
  now turn away from the West. Indeed, Habermas has worried so
  much, so publicly, that he has been attacked -- unfairly he says
  -- as a foe of reunification.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The winds
  shifted in Europe just when Habermas felt that his great cause
  was going well. "For almost 40 years," he explains, "I struggled
  against what I thought was the dangerous tendency toward . . .
  continuations of those anti-Western traditions that prepared the
  German population for a rather strong support of the Nazis after
  1933." But this nightmare did not come true. In the Federal
  Republic, Enlightenment values seem to have, for the most part,
  won out. (Habermas believes these values are in some ways now
  more at home in Germany than in France or America, whose
  phalanxes of postmodernists delight in deconstructing
  them.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"During
  the postwar period, particularly since the late '60s, the Federal
  Republic got more and more politically civilized," Habermas
  observes. "And now I'm defending a continuation of this process
  rather than hailing the break of 1989."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  Western democracies still have great social and political
  problems. The danger that the Germany of his childhood might
  return can never entirely be dismissed. Habermas, undoubtedly,
  will have no difficulty getting sufficiently agitated to write
  more newspaper articles. However, an additional benefit of
  remembering the past is gaining perspective on the present. And
  from the living room of his modern house in the heart of Bavaria,
  which is flooded by light from the west, Habermas sees reason, if
  not having triumphed, at least having made great progress. "Why
  stop?" he asks. "Why not continue?"</font></p>
