  Journalism</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1"><i><font color="#FF8000">American
  Journalism</font></i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There is,
  to be blunt about it, no such thing as a history of American
  journalism. The development of American journalism was influenced
  � if not transformed, if not determined � in every period by
  developments outside of America. To pretend otherwise, as we too
  often do in our courses and our writings, is to distort history.
  American journalism did not, in any sense, develop
  alone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This fact
  about journalism history does not have to be understood
  historically. It is plain enough in our own era. In what country
  today do the media evolve in isolation?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The United
  States may currently be the major source of forms of
  communication that wander across borders. However, the United
  States is certainly not immune to having its own borders
  transgressed. People � Rupert Murdoch and Tina Brown are examples
  � have brought strategies here from elsewhere. Corporations �
  Bertelsmann, Murdoch�s News Corporation � have made significant
  incursions. Ideas are borrowed from foreign publications, foreign
  television shows, foreign Web sites. Would, to pick a notable
  example, NPR be possible without the BBC or CBC?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It was, of
  course, ever thus. Indeed, this point would have been as obvious
  to American journalists in earlier centuries as it now is to
  journalists elsewhere in the world, who feel the influence of CNN
  or <i>Newsweek</i>. For America then was much more the recipient
  than the source of ideas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">My
  favorite example currently hangs on my living room wall. I
  purchased it for a couple of hundred dollars a few years ago. It
  is a small and not particularly rare newspaper called
  <i>Domestick Intelligence, Or News both from City and Country</i>
  and published in London on August 5, 1679. This newspaper was of
  significance in England at the time, both for its emphasis upon
  local news and its precocious sensationalism. (My copy includes a
  story about a man who was stabbed in a bar fight.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However,
  my interest in <i>Domestick Intelligence</i> derives primarily
  from its publisher. The name printed at the bottom of the second
  and last page is "Benjamin Harris." In other words, this
  newspaper was published by the man who would, eleven years later,
  publish America�s first newspaper. That newspaper, <i>Publick
  Occurrences, Both Foreign and Domestick</i>, looked quite a bit
  like its older brother on my wall. It can best be understood, as
  can its publisher, as a product of late-seventeenth-century
  London journalism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And this
  is hardly the only evidence of the absurdity of delaying the
  start of the history of journalism, as we too often do, until
  1690, when a newspaper first appears in England�s American
  colonies. As Félix Gutiérrez has reported, a news publication,
  though not a periodical, had been printed in Mexico City in 1541.
  (This too, of course, was the younger sibling of much older
  European newsbooks.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The word
  that probably appeared most in the titles of early colonial
  newspapers was "gazette." Boston�s first newspaper was the
  <i>Boston Gazette</i>; New York�s first, the <i>New York
  Gazette</i>; Maryland�s first, the <i>Maryland Gazette</i>; and
  Benjamin Franklin took over and made a success of the
  <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>. This too, of course, was a borrowing
  from Europe. The most influential newspaper in France in the
  seventeenth century was the <i>Gazette de France</i>. The most
  influential newspaper in England in that century was the
  <i>London Gazette</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Indeed,
  this is a word that turns up over and over again throughout the
  history of the newspaper. Russians actually call their newspapers
  "<i>gazeta."</i> The word can be traced back to handwritten
  newssheets � sometimes known as <i>gazzette</i> � distributed
  weekly, as I have shown in my <i>book A History of News</i>, in
  Venice as early as 1566.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Venice in
  the mid-sixteenth century is, consequently, one place a history
  of journalism, at least newspaper journalism, might begin. I
  believe a genetic examination of every newspaper in America,
  along with every newspaper published anywhere in the world today,
  would turn up some DNA that can be traced back to these
  handwritten weeklies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  content of American newspapers in the colonial period and beyond
  consisted primarily, as we know, of items taken from European
  newspapers. To be an American newspaper printer in 1760 in a port
  city, consequently, required pouring through as many English,
  French and other foreign newspapers as it was possible get off
  the ships. Those papers were generally more advanced in reporting
  methods, in typography, in design and in writing style than
  American newspapers. They remained so into the nineteenth
  century. Our editors, consequently, borrowed more than stories
  from them. European newspapers provided the forms from which
  American journalism was cast � and recast.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider
  just the most obvious contributions from just one country:
  England. London had a "penny press" before New York had a "penny
  press." Reporting developed in London many decades before it came
  to America. ("To report" was a British term for taking shorthand,
  and the first regular American "beat" � police court � was
  inspired, in part, by police court coverage in London.) America�s
  tabloids were unabashedly based on London�s tabloids. (The term
  itself was borrowed from the British pharmaceutical industry.)
  And a late-twentieth-century wave of tabloid journalism in the
  United States might arguably be traced to the purchase of the
  <i>New York Post</i> by an Australian who had mastered the art
  form in London.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Given the
  extent of European influence upon the American press it is
  certainly not surprising that the three men who might reasonably
  be labeled the most creative forces in American journalism were
  all men who had an opportunity to look at European newspapers
  before they were loaded onto ships. Two � James Gordon Bennett
  Sr. and Joseph Pulitzer � were, as were so many great American
  journalists, immigrants to this country. The third, Benjamin
  Franklin, spent formative years in England.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">To attempt
  to separate the history of American journalism from developments
  overseas seems, therefore, as foolish as attempting to separate
  the history of journalism in Ohio or Kansas from what was
  happening in Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Yet we do � over
  and over again. There are relatively few American journalism
  historians who are familiar with the history of English or French
  or German or even Mexican journalism. A kind of ignorance � which
  would not be tolerated in literature departments, in theater
  departments, in art departments, in science departments � is
  routinely accepted in journalism departments. American journalism
  history is dangerously and unflaggingly parochial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However,
  in this too, although we may be the worst offenders, we are not
  alone. I have met Dutch and French journalism historians who know
  an awful lot about the history of, for example, English
  journalism, but not more than a handful of them. Most English,
  French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese or Italian journalism
  historians are specialists only in the history of journalism in
  their own countries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">As a
  result, we have a lot of local journalism histories that
  underplay or ignore the countless notions that drifted across
  borders in what has always been a cosmopolitan business. As a
  result, countless potentially instructive parallels remain
  unexplored. As a result, many of the major stories in this
  history � stories that are inescapably multi-national � remain
  untold.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  development of the direct ancestors of the newspaper in
  early-modern Europe � before and after the Venetian gazettes � is
  an example. I have done some (primitive) work in this area. There
  is much more to do. But it is research that will require
  comparison of early news publications in Italy, Germany, Belgium
  and Holland, at the very least.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  printed newspaper is at the heart of all of our journalism
  histories. German researchers recently found evidence that one of
  what we had thought of as the two earliest European printed
  newspapers, Johann Carolus�s Strasbourg weekly, had actually
  begun publication four years earlier � in 1605. In some fields
  this is news that would instantly race around the world. But I
  wouldn�t be surprised if it takes decades to find its way into
  journalism history textbooks in the United States and elsewhere
  outside of Germany.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Our
  narrowly nationalistic journalism histories, in other words, not
  only obscure crucial connections and lineages and ignore telling
  comparisons, they leave us unable to approach fundamental
  questions. We must internationalize our conferences, our
  journals, our graduate programs and our research. Journalism has
  never been held back by borders. It is time for journalism
  historians to begin crossing them.</font></p>
