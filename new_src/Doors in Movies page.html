  <title>Codexes, Ligatures and the Internet - Mitchell
  Stephens</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FF33FF">
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">Why There
  Are So Many Doors in Movies:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+2">Codexes, Ligatures and the
  Internet</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+2">Columbia Journalism Review,
  March/April 2000</font></p>
  <p><a href="MS_Home.html"><font face="Arial" size="+2">Mitchell
  Stephens</font></a></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">In an effort to gain perspective
  on the future of the Internet, I recently sat down and watched,
  notebook in hand, the 1946 version of The Postman Always Rings
  Twice. This film, like so many old movies and television shows,
  is filled with shots of characters going through doors. I
  counted. There are 118 such shots.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Contemplating all those opening
  and closing doors a half-century later, we smirk. What are they
  doing there? I suspect that if the film's director, Tay Garnett,
  had been asked, he would have alluded to the need to guide
  audiences in and out of scenes. John Garfield can't just
  magically appear, all hot and bothered, in Lana Turner's kitchen.
  We need, the director might have explained, to see how he got
  there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">But, in fact, we don't need that.
  As has become clear in recent decades, audiences are quite
  capable of following sequences in which a character is in one
  room in one shot and in another room (or even another country) in
  the next. The door (or airplane), you might say, is assumed. When
  Bob Rafelson remade The Postman Always Rings Twice in 1981, Jack
  Nicholson, Jessica Lange and company pursued each other through
  only (only?) 77 doors. Were the film remade again today, the door
  count would undoubtedly decline further.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">To explain all those doors, it is
  necessary to look to the direct ancestor of film and most
  television, to their model: theater. Characters on stage can't
  arrive in or depart from a scene without making an entrance or
  exit, without, in other words, passing through a door. That was
  the way it was done. It became, naturally enough, what filmmakers
  did. New forms of communication invariably imitate the forms that
  came before. As we try to figure out how to make use of such
  marvelous but unfamiliar new methods of informing and
  entertaining ourselves, we do the obvious thing: We borrow from
  their more familiar, if somewhat less marvelous,
  predecessors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Some of these borrowings make
  sense. Perhaps the best historical example is the codex, which
  had been introduced in the Roman Empire as a replacement for
  unwieldy scrolls. The codex divided writings into pages, bound
  together. When the first printing presses were assembled in
  Europe in the fifteenth century, those who operated them borrowed
  the codex form from the handwritten manuscripts they were using
  as their model. It worked just fine. Our printed books and
  magazines still appear in what is, in essence, the form of the
  handwritten codex.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Many such borrowings, however,
  work less well. Ligatures may be the classic example. Scribes
  saved energy by connecting some of the letters in the words they
  copied; early printers wasted energy molding extra type in an
  effort to reproduce these ligatures. Why? It is easy once again
  to smirk, but that was simply the way it was done. Gutenberg and
  his contemporaries would be long gone before those vestigial
  remnants of the days of scribes, ligatures, began to disappear
  from print.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">The history of communication is
  full of examples of similarly wrongheaded imitations. For the
  first couple of decades of this century, for example, the
  fledgling radio industry was doing its best to produce "wireless
  telegraphy" or "wireless telephony" - an ether-borne version, in
  other words, of one-to-one communication. However, radio's great
  strength (at least until the arrival of cellular phones) turned
  out to be mass communication:
  [ital]broad[ital]casting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Now it is the Internet that is
  new. One method of trying to understand which way it might be
  heading is to examine its borrowings - and they are many. Then we
  might begin the rather more difficult task of trying to figure
  out which of these imports might prove as useful as the codex,
  which as foolish as printed ligatures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Computers initially were passed
  off as big-brained adding machines or typewriters. Then they were
  decked out as if they were desktops. (A "metaphor," this
  particular imitation was labeled.) While we were still trying to
  get comfortable with that little scissors symbol, the Internet
  sprang to life on our screens - in the form of an electronic
  postal system. Normally societies precede their communications
  systems, but this imitation postal system, in a dazzling
  reversal, then gave birth to a whole imitation community, filled
  with "sites" -- the Web.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Whew! It would be useful to have
  another decade or so to figure out whether this current
  conception of the Internet as a kind of easily traversed,
  endlessly interconnected town, with addresses and shops, is the
  best with which we can come up. (Couldn't we at least lose those
  annoying "dots" and the "www"s?) But, of course, billions of
  dollars have already been spent constructing businesses to occupy
  these "sites." (Never has so much been invested so quickly in the
  success of a metaphor.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">The business model through which
  most of these investors hope to enrich themselves - selling
  audiences to advertisers - is, predictably, a straight borrowing
  from other media, particularly television. TV had stolen it from
  radio. Radio had stumbled upon this method of pocketing soap and
  cigarette money late and almost by accident; the telegraph and
  telephone, after all, hadn't carried ads.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Advertising seems - naturally
  enough, this being the way things are currently done - a
  reasonable way for a Web site to make money. (Especially inasmuch
  as the other immediately available model - charging admission to
  the "site" - apparently has worked only for dirty pictures and
  the Wall Street Journal.) However, if investors weren't so busy
  bidding up the price of each other's holdings, they might be
  worrying a bit more about the audiences they will be able to
  offer advertisers. Yes, those audiences can be carefully
  targeted, but there's also a good chance that, in the endlessly
  fragmented (more telephone- or telegraph-like?) world of the Web,
  those audiences will be piddling. I suspect the cute, animated
  advertising "banners" we're all so adept at ignoring may start to
  look a little like ligatures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">And then there's the question of
  what form of information is actually being provided by the
  Internet. When you click on any of our news-oriented Web sites -
  from cnn.com to drudgereport.com to salon.com - what you are
  greeted by is, in essence, a table of contents. This is another
  interesting borrowing - from print. It may even qualify as a
  borrowing that makes sense. Web sites, in journalism at least,
  have now in fact become elaborate, cross-referenced, multi-level,
  searchable tables of contents, with all the articles attached.
  This is quite useful, whether you want to know more about East
  Timor, Al Gore or Beck's tour. Maybe the table of contents will
  someday be seen as having done for the Web what the codex did for
  print.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Or maybe not. Almost all the
  articles that are now being so effectively indexed and linked on
  line have "headlines" and are organized into "pages." And with
  the exception of occasional videos (which remain, for the moment,
  low-resolution and small-screen), they all could, and in many
  cases did, appear in a newspaper or magazine. The Web may be
  structured like a community; it may hope to finance itself like
  television; but its content - its news content - is currently
  just about pure print. Imitation of this intensity, history tells
  us, is a sign that a form of communication has not yet found its
  way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">A new medium usually has to
  overcome a strong tendency to devote itself almost entirely to
  the products of the much more respected older medium it is
  imitating. Only then can it come up with original products of its
  own. Writing had to do more than preserve the ancient epics.
  Printing had to do more than make the old handwritten manuscripts
  accessible. Film and television had (have) to do more than aim
  cameras at plays.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="+1">Is what we are seeing in this,
  the infancy of the Internet mere "digital newspapery" or "digital
  magazinery"? Will a Columbia Journalism Review writer someday sit
  down and count all the "pages" in a typical Web "site" back at
  the turn of the millennium that were turned over to listings of
  unimaginatively print-like articles? Will that person's readers
  smirk?</font></p>
