  OF THE WORD</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">By <a href="MS_Home.html">Mitchell
  Stephens</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Oxford University Press, $ 27.50.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">THE premise of The <font color="#FF0000">Rise
  of the Image, the Fall of the Word</font> is contained in the
  title. While the declining significance of words and the
  increasingly central role of images in our culture is not an
  original idea, this book offers a new take on a familiar
  lament.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">What makes this volume unique is that the
  author, Mitchell Stephens, a professor of journalism and mass
  communication at New York University, argues that the trend
  should not trouble us. Video has the potential to, in his words,
  "present us with new mental vistas, to take us to new philosophic
  places, as writing once did, as printing once did." It has, he
  asserts, the potential to be "better than print."</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Every medium takes awhile to develop its own
  aesthetic. Video today is fairly derivative, borrowing genres,
  styles and content from previous media such as radio, theater and
  film.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Stephens is not a defender of television or
  what he calls the first era of video. What he champions is "new
  video." This new video will be fast and densely packed, will
  venture beyond narrative, rely heavily upon computer graphics and
  upon juxtaposition, and be structured more like music than
  prose.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Although he provides some examples that hint
  at the power of this new mode of expression, examples pulled from
  popular culture (MTV clips, Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers,
  the first 96 seconds of an ABC News documentary), he contends
  that the movement is just now starting to unfold.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Once mature, video will be able to communicate
  highly complex ideas and thought without words; it will be "a
  form of communication powerful enough to help us fashion new
  understandings, stronger understandings."</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">While people have long possessed the tools to
  acquire moving images, now theyhave access to both hardware and
  software to manipulate and edit images. They also have a vast,
  new, unprecedented vehicle for distribution, the Internet, which
  will soon become a more video-friendly channel. Such trends will
  help promote the aesthetic development of a visual mode of
  communication.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Stephens expects many of his ideas will be
  controversial. He addresses the common rebuttals. He points out
  that a look back reveals the unease with which people faced
  writing and printing in their infancy. The sweeping warnings of
  the damage that the handwritten or machine-printed word would
  bring seem ludicrous in hindsight. We are, it would seem, merely
  overreacting the way others did. If words and books didn't bring
  us down, then video won't either.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This book does not belittle the power of word.
  Stephens is an admitted book lover and author, and he notes the
  word's powerful ability to help us look inward, to explore inner
  states and the inner worlds of hidden thoughts.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Yet, he argues, today the magic of print has
  begun to run out as we have "explored our insides to the point of
  self-obsession." Perhaps the most controversial idea in the book:
  It is time for print to fall. We are no longer on print's quest
  for the essence of a person; we are now on a quest for "an
  understanding of the perspective of people: how and what they
  see," a quest best fulfilled through the power of new uses of
  video.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This book offers a unique and refreshing
  perspective on what has mostly been a one-sided debate over the
  linked fate of words and our culture. For Stephens, the fall of
  words is not the end of the world but a new sort of beginning,
  and in the long term the "moving image is likely to make our
  thoughts not more feeble but more robust."</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Is his optimism founded? It is too early to
  tell. Is his argument totally convincing? Not entirely, but it is
  certainly compelling and engaging, and it isnot as easy to
  dismiss as one would think.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">It is unlikely that this book will convince
  bibliophiles that their beloved medium has inherent weaknesses
  and may not be the most appropriate or vital for the 21st
  century. Will this book prompt people to change their positions
  on the debate over the <font color="#FF0000">rise of the image
  and the fall of the word?</font> Perhaps. It will undoubtedly
  require skeptics to rethink their prejudice against the power and
  potential of the moving image.</font></p>
