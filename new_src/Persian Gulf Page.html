  department of journalism and mass communication at New York
  University and author of "A History of News"
  (Penguin).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">BODY:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">WHERE DID
  ALL the protesters go? That's one of the questions that remains
  now that the dust raised by the Persian Gulf war has begun to
  settle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A major
  antiwar movement seemed to be mobilizing in the early days of the
  war. The vote in Congress authorizing the president to use force
  to expel Iraq from Kuwait was relatively close. And tens of
  thousands of Americans in Washington and other cities
  demonstrated their opposition to the war in its first
  weeks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But the
  protests began petering out even before the war ended. Was this
  because the administration succeeded in convincing most Americans
  that it was, in fact, a "just war"? One way to answer this
  question is to examine the fate of previous American antiwar
  movements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There have
  been a lot of them. Active and highly visible dissent accompanied
  not just Vietnam but every major war fought by the United States,
  with the exception of World War II after Pearl Harbor (the one
  time our territory was unambiguously attacked first).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  Revolutionary War, for example, had its inglorious "Tories" -
  perhaps a third of the population of the colonies. The Civil War
  had its "copperheads," who staged some of the largest riots in
  American history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">With
  perhaps better cause, every Federalist member of Congress voted
  against the War of 1812. And opponents of the decision to involve
  the United States in World War I filled Madison Square Garden
  with their protest meetings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  intensity of these antiwar movements has always ebbed and flowed
  with events. The reason dissent faded during the Persian Gulf war
  becomes clearer when we look at the cause of such variations in
  the strength of opposition to earlier American wars:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">During the
  Civil War, with Southern armies proving surprisingly formidable,
  antiwar sentiment in the North was so widespread that President
  Abraham Lincoln became convinced that he would be "badly beaten"
  in the 1864 presidential election. The Democratic party platform
  that year was written by a leading copperhead or "Peace
  Democrat."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But
  Lincoln was reelected easily. Support for the war had skyrocketed
  by the time voters went to the polls. What had happened? The
  situation on the battlefields had taken a dramatic turn for the
  better: A Union army had succeeded in taking Atlanta.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  necessity and justice of the Spanish-American War in 1898 had
  been vociferously debated in the press before the declaration of
  war was approved (by a margin of only seven votes in the Senate).
  And after the Spanish were routed, difficulties subduing Filipino
  insurgents and securing control of one of the spoils of the war
  almost led to the defeat of the peace treaty with
  Spain.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But while
  the fighting with Spain was actually going on, this war was as
  popular as any in our history. Why? Because it was being quickly
  and easily won.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">U.S.
  military involvement in Korea began in the spring of 1950 with
  overwhelming popular support. By January of 1951, however, 49
  percent of Americans, according to one survey, believed that
  sending troops to Korea was a mistake; 66 percent, that we should
  leave. What had changed? The Chinese had entered the war and
  American forces began suffering major defeats.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Opposition
  to the Vietnam War, too, intensified dramatically as the war
  progressed or, in this case, dragged on. The cause? By the late
  1960s, the public began to realize that, despite the impressive
  body counts and "pacification" programs, the war was not being
  won - a realization brought on in part by the initial success of
  the Viet Cong's Tet offensive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Many base
  their opposition to wars on principle. Northern abolitionists -
  including Henry David Thoreau and such Whig members of Congress
  as Lincoln - saw the Mexican War, which began in 1846, as an
  "unnecessary and unconstitutional" war of "conquest," designed to
  add more slave states to the union. The fact that American armies
  were triumphing did not make this war any more acceptable to
  them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Matters of
  principle also motivated most of the more committed opponents of
  sending American troops to the trenches of World War I, the
  hamlets of Vietnam or the oil fields of Kuwait.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However,
  despite all the debate about "just wars," the bulk of the
  American people typically seem to base their support or
  opposition on another consideration: how well a war is
  going.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  Persian Gulf war went well. The protest movement
  fizzled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Our
  leaders can easily draw the wrong conclusion from this
  experience. Does it mean that "the Vietnam syndrome" is behind
  us, that the American people can be counted on to remain united
  behind future, perhaps less successful, military adventures? It
  does not.</font></p>
