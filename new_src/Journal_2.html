      along with some vague nervousness and lots of (mostly
      purposeful) taking umbrage, is a one-day layover in
      <font color="#804000">Paris</font>. There are worse fates. So
      traveling impressively light (my luggage being trapped in
      their hopeless system), I alight upon "my"</font> <font face=

      <i>his</i> hotels)</font></b></font><font size="+1">: Hotel
      de la Sorbonne. It's still there. It ain't as cheap as I
      hoped. I succeed in restricting my nap to a couple of hours
      and then am free -- after a successful visit to a favorite
      bookstore, Shakespeare & Co. -- to do what I like with this
      city. What I like (or at least am capable of coming up with),
      as usual, turns out to be <font color="#804000">to
      walk</font> -- to walk until I have seen what I seem to need
      to see; until I am, without a jacket in early March, warm;
      until I feel as if I've been in Paris; until the muscles at
      the top of my thighs burn. I give myself various
      assignments:</font> <font face=
      "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">trying to
      divine the secret of the success of the dazzlingly
      appropriate and unobtrusive pyramid within the U of the
      Louvre</font></b></font><font size="+1">, seeing the richness
      and taste that the well-trained if not widely traveled eyes
      of my father-in-law saw in this city, seeing the ugliness
      that was once seen in that overgrown paperweight, the Tour
      Eiffel (looking as if it were surrounded by water and glass
      and as if snow would start falling if you shock it).
      <font color="#804000">March 5.</font></font></b></font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And
      I walk a few blocks out of my way to search for the hotel
      (certainly not mine) I stayed in on my last visit a few years
      ago. And I almost walk all the way to the spot from which I
      first presented my daughter, then two and a half, with the
      Eiffel Tower, and she began to twirl in joy. For all the
      pleasure of first times and seeing new, it is hard to beat
      the doubled, time-travel pleasure of <font color=
      "#804000">revisiting</font> and remembering. I'm sure there's
      a fine quote from Proust on this subject, which I'd locate if
      I had Proust. And have I succeeded in bragging that I have
      been to this city awfully many times before (even if it was
      usually August)?</font></b></p>

      grin." I would even have done some of my walking in a museum,
      of all places -- Orsay -- if it weren't closed on
      <i>Lundi</i>. I even locate and, more surprisingly, direct
      myself to the right cafe for my beer: Les Deux Magots. Though

      day's observation): Yes, there are fewer men carrying
      handbags, fewer (I have the statistics) cafes, and a Gap has
      opened on the Place de la Sorbonne. But I see a sufficient
      number of signs of the culture's resiliency in the face of
      the global/American onslaught: (1) closely cropped trees; (2)
      young men whose heads tend not to be closely cropped
      (bagginess seems to have a similarly limited impact on their
      jeans); (3) multiple cheek kissing (I believe the currently
      appropriate number is: two); (4) unusual density, in many
      neighborhoods, of bookstores; (5) "<i>homeopathie</i>" signs
      in the windows of pharmacies; (6) the absence of signed
      photos of Picasso and Sartre with their arms around the owner

      that there is insufficient information upon which to base
      such wide-angle conclusions, given that it is my first day in
      Africa, <font color="#804000">March 7</font>. And then I'm
      thinking -- and this, alas, is also typical -- that there is
      never enough information, whether on the thirtieth day or in
      the thirtieth year, to enable a mind to find its way around

      trying to get someone in the street to get help in the hotel,
      is unattractive. But, miraculously, I come up with a second
      alternative: I put on the pants I had just washed, climb
      around to a neighboring balcony and go through an open door
      back into the hotel. Then, in my sopping-wet pants, I find

      belt, carrying four hundred-dollar bills. They got wet. I lay
      them out to dry. I visit a bar. I realize, after the bar, on
      my way to a restaurant, that the bills are still laying there
      in my room -- entirely exposed. I rush back. I learn that not

      we got back. But, dutifully, I ask about a tour. Same
      problem: all costs divided only by one. But we shave those
      costs down to a manageable, for work, 25 bucks and me and
      that same guide set out, by taxi, south, to the Gandiol area.

      a Fula, Fulani was his first (of four) languages. Paved road
      turns to dirt and sometimes back again. Twenty minutes from
      St. Louis we get out of a taxi and follow a sandy path --
      there is no road cause they have no cars -- to the small
      village of <font color="#804000">Dell</font>. Along the path
      we see the classic sign of the Fulani: cattle dung. Former
      nomads, they keep (and keep and don't sell) cattle/cows. They
      milk them and sell the milk and use the money to purchase
      rice, vegetables and fish. Such is the Fulani economy. Wealth
      is measured by the size of your herd. ("They would let
      someone die rather than sell one cattle to buy medicine," my

      <font color="#804000">ten children</font>, ranging in age
      from about four to twenty-two. These kids speak only Fulani.
      Their feet -- all of their feet -- look more used, older than
      mine. They have no plumbing or toilets of any kind; they use
      the bush. They have <font color="#804000">grown up
      without</font> TV, though they all have occasionally seen
      movies on TV in another village. They have grown up without
      telephone or electricity, though there are flashlights
      hanging on the wall and a battery-operated radio/cassette
      player on the floor. (None have heard of Madonna; all say
      they know Senegal's top musician: Youssou N'Dour.) Their
      parents own no motorized vehicles, though they all have
      ridden in one at one time or another. And none of these
      children, a first in my experience, have gone to school. The
      boys memorize, without understanding my guide says, passages
      from the Koran. But no real school. "We would like to," a
      teenage girl says through the translator, "but it is not a
      concern of our parents." One of these girls stands barefoot

      and do dishes. The boys "follow" the cattle. What do these
      children <font color="#804000">play</font>? "We just
      reproduce" -- my translator insists this is in fact the word
      one of the girls uses, twice -- "everyday life in our games.

      me dolls they have fashioned out of cloth, with plastic hair.
      Another shows me a kitchen scene she has assembled, with a
      busted flashlight and plastic bottle combining to serve as
      table and various plastic scraps and and old battery as
      plates and pots. Later she turns the same set of objects into
      a small shop. Enterprising. Creative. Resourceful.
      Nonviolent. Respectful of tradition. A perfect example of the
      ways of a non-global childhood. But I keep thinking of
      something a cafe owner in Oaxaca, Mexico, had allowed about
      the global culture: "It frees <font color="#804000">the

      I was going to buy at the market, but I didn't know how to

      blowing, and men and women dressed in a fashion that can only
      be captured by the cliché: biblical. And in the midst of all

      you to things like this.) It is important, to begin with,
      because it is actually rather wonderful. Bahal, Walid, me,
      the Auberge-keeper and some buddies of the Auberge-keeper are
      lounging around on mats in the middle of that courtyard.
      Yeah, there is some television in this town. The Auberge guy
      has offered to show me what he can pull in on his satellite
      dish. But the cooperative-supplied electricity, produced by a
      diesel generator, is only on from eight thirty to ten thirty.
      And we're outside, under the stars, lounging and talking, not
      watching celebrities talk. The tea is poured back and forth,
      from a height, from little pot to the little glasses -- to
      give it a nice head of foam. Couscous. They take it by hand
      from a shared bowl. And <font color="#804000">life</font> is
      looking pretty good here in Chinguetti except for the fact
      that there are no women around, the fact that most of the
      fellows lounging here explain that they want desperately to
      leave this life for one in America, and the fact that the
      16-year-old very dark skinned boy who has been helping serve,
      without being thanked or joining in the conversation, may in
      some way be -- and I use this word with great trepidation and
      tentativeness -- a slave. I will, of course,

      feel warm and cool at the same time. (Has the desert sun
      already addled my brain?) And we -- Bahal the guide, Walid

      I'm worried it's going to be like making 63 trips from the
      lifeguard towers to the refreshment stands at West End 2,
      without the diversion of scantily clad bodies. But the
      walking ain't so bad. A cool breeze is blowing, sometimes
      sprinkling a bit of sand on the horizon. (Make this trip in
      June or July, I'm told, and no breeze will manage to seem
      cool.) Occasionally, we can spot a long-robed character,
      sometimes leading a camel, approaching. And I have -- ain't
      this the place for this kind of thing -- a revelation
      <font color="#804000">here in the anti-fog</font>: The desert
      (new thing, found) -- far from being a raw, ugly place, in
      which humans just barely manage to survive, a torment, a test
      -- is actually quite pleasant. (Perhaps you knew this but
      somehow neglected to clue me in.) It's beautiful. I ain't
      parched. Those long-robed characters are invariably
      smiling.</font></font></b></p>

      <i>ride</i> I am on, I am paying for. But, there being only
      one camel, I'm already feeling a little uncomfortable about
      that. With natives walking, a tourist riding can appear a
      little soft, a little spoiled. (Of course, since this tourist
      is funding the whole expedition, it's kind of hard to imagine
      him appearing like a hardened desert person.) After an hour
      or so, <font color="#804000">the camel</font> gets down on
      his thin knees; the tourist uses a camel leg for a boost and
      climbs up into the saddle; the camel rises quickly but in
      stages -- nearly throwing said tourist to the sandy ground;
      and we begin to clomp along.</font></b></p>

      color="#000000">That, incidentally, is when I first notice
      <font color="#804000">the flies</font>. Some parts of the
      camel are literally covered with them. Some parts of turbaned
      me are soon covered with them. Here, I'm thinking, is an
      authentic desert torment, a plague. But the thing about the
      flies is that they seem content just to ride along. Adjust
      your turban and they all go buzzing about. But then they
      settle down. And as long as you discourage them from settling
      on your nose or glasses, they produce, despite their great
      numbers, no particular discomfort. The point is, I guess,
      that this works -- this desert life works. And I imagine most
      lives work, in this sense. Humans have, in other words, made
      themselves comfortable in most of the places where they have
      settled: the Sahara, the Amazon, Jersey City and, I imagine,
      the Arctic. Whatever bugs cause major discomfort long ago got
      smacked and, consequently, eliminated. The spirits of the
      these people move, as our spirits do, sometimes up, sometimes
      down. Or I am just basing conclusions, once again, on too
      little evidence? Was I or am I being naive? It's often so

      on here is so different from what we think of as slavery that
      it is wrong to use the same word. No one, they say, is being
      sold or whipped. We're talking about a kind of family
      servant. They take the position that the problems with this

      a supermarket. I pay. They return to the large, open flat at
