  <p><font face="Courier New">BODY:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">RUPERT MURDOCH'S likely return to
  control of the New York Post may be good for the newspaper's
  employees, but it is disturbing news for those of us who are
  concerned with keeping political debate in this city honest and
  fair. For Murdoch was more than the publisher who, with such
  headlines as "Headless Body in Topless Bar," began the current
  wave of tabloid sensationalism in New York City. He was, during
  his first run as the Post's owner, from 1977 to 1988,
  unscrupulous in his use of the paper's news columns to advance
  his political causes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Almost all American daily newspapers
  today at least try to keep their editorial opinions from
  influencing their news coverage. It is a worthy effort, given how
  few newspapers are left for readers to turn to for news. The Post
  under Murdoch made no such effort.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Here are some examples from studies I
  helped conduct:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">During the month before the 1977
  mayoral primary, the Post's early editions ran no unfavorable
  stories about Murdoch's candidate, Edward Koch, but many nasty
  stories about Koch's opponents, such as "The Blond Millionairess
  Whose Big Bucks Back Cuomo." The Post mentioned Koch favorably in
  four front-page headlines; the six other candidates were
  mentioned favorably on the front page a total of once. Koch
  received 32 inches of favorable coverage on pages 2 through 5,
  all the other candidates, including the incumbent, Mayor Abraham
  Beame, a total of 35 inches.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">In 1980, Murdoch's support of Ronald
  Reagan in his race for the presidency against Jimmy Carter
  spilled all over the Post's news columns, as was apparent in
  these headlines: "Reagan: I'll Save the Middle Class" - a scoop
  proclaimed in red ink on the front page. "Israel Fears Carter
  Victory" - the article referred to by this front-page headline
  included no quotes from any Israeli, named or unnamed, supporting
  the charge. "Stars Want Ron to Get the Part" - no stars
  supporting Carter were quoted. "Khomeini Pulls the Strings," and
  then in smaller type, "Carter Back on Campaign Trail" - this
  intriguing pairing of thoughts was given two-thirds of the front
  page on the day before the election.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">On Jan. 25, 1982, a front-page
  headline in the Post - not, of course, labeled an editorial -
  proposed "Ed Koch for Governor." Koch had not entered the race
  and had not been included 10 days earlier in the newspaper's
  discussion of 11 possible candidates. But, after the paper
  invited readers to fill out a Koch for Governor coupon on its
  news pages every weekday for the next two weeks and ran news
  headlines such as "Apple Loves Koch," the then-mayor eventually
  entered the primary, which he went on to lose to Mario
  Cuomo.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">When other papers "endorse you, you
  get one column on the editorial page," groused Cuomo at the time.
  "With Rupert, he turns the whole paper over to you."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Murdoch's flagrantly partisan style
  of journalism was common in the United States a hundred years
  ago. But then each city had many newspapers; they balanced each
  other's slants. New York now has only three other
  general-circulation dailies, and they attempt to honor the line
  between news coverage and opinion columns or editorials. If
  Murdoch returns, there will again be no one to balance his
  front-page crusades and assaults.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">That may be one reason so many
  politicians, including Cuomo, are trying to get on Murdoch's good
  side by helping in his bid to regain control of the Post. Because
  his support extended beyond the editorial page, Murdoch was for a
  time arguably the most powerful political force in the country's
  largest city. He may very well become that again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">The problem, if Murdoch regains
  control, is that the city's newspaper readers, conditioned to
  expect a different kind of journalism, may not understand that
  many of the news stories they will be reading in the Post may not
  be the result of normal reporting but rather expressions of the
  publisher's personal political preferences. That would be
  unfortunate for them and for the political life of this
  city.</font></p>
