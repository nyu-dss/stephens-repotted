  <p>____1902-1903 <b>Alexander Posey. Series of letters from "Fus
  Fixico"</b> that appeared in the <i>Indian Journal</i> of the old
  Indian Territory. Fabulous satire of current events. Called for
  the end of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. (Mark N. Trahant)</p>
  <p>____1902-1904 (series first published in <i>McClure�s</i>
  magazine, book published in 1904) <b>Lincoln Steffens. "Shame of
  the Cities."</b> Enough said. (Todd Gitlin) The origins of
  today�s muckracking, and the shaming effects of investigative
  reporting, are found here. (Jay Rosen) Sets the forms and aims of
  modern urban reporting and investigative reporting for two
  generations. A muckraking classic. (Anne Matthews) Classic--the
  classic--muckraking. Crucial in calling attention to municipal
  corruption. Led to reforms in some cities. Not enough, argued
  Steffens. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1902-1904 (book 1904) <b>Ida Tarbell. "History of Standard
  Oil" investigation.</b> Also in <i>McClure�s</i> magazine.
  Documented ruthless monopolistic practices. Contributed to
  successful effort to break up Rockefeller oil monopoly. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1903 <b>W.E.B. DuBois. "The Souls of Black Folk."</b> The
  precursor to Baldwin and even to "The Autobiography of Malcolm
  X." Seems to me part of an on-going colloquy about the very
  nature of racism and its evil manifestations. Heartachingly
  measured, but has an integrity and on-going freshness that makes
  it as important today as when it was published. (Madeleine
  Blais)</p>
  <p>____1914 <b>Walter Lippmann. Early essays for the <i>New
  Republic</i>.</b> Extraordinarily symmetric prose and an
  extraordinarily clear mind (Leaner in his youth?): "Every sane
  person knows that it is a greater thing to build a city than to
  bombard it, to plough a field than to trample it, to serve
  mankind than to conquer it. And yet once the armies get loose,
  the terrific noise and shock of war make all that was valuable
  seem pale and dull and sentimental." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1914 <b>Richard Harding Davis. Coverage of German march
  into Belgium.</b> Several versions of this account appeared in
  daily newspapers, magazines, books, etc. The Collier�s version is
  wonderful. All are vivid and put the reader on the scene. "Like a
  river of steel, it flowed," Davis said of the army. (Gene
  Roberts) An aging reporter who�d cheapened his craft for a decade
  with thumbsucking pieces and parlor-car-window dispatches has a
  last flash of brilliance: in the right place at the right time,
  he conveys the texture of a strange new concept--world
  war--through pure description: journalism as the first rough
  draft of history, indeed. (Anne Matthews) A bit of derring-do
  (after an attempt to get through German lines Davis was arrested
  as a spy) from the archetype of the romantic war correspondent
  and one of our best reporters and writers. "The entrance of the
  German army into Brussels has lost the human quality. . . . What
  came . . . is not men marching, but a force of nature like a
  tidal wave, and avalanche or a river flooding its banks. At this
  minute it is rolling through Brussels as the swollen waters of
  the Conemaugh Valley swept through Johnstown." (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1914 <b>Max Eastman. Editorials in <i>The Masses</i>
  regarding the 1913 Ludlow Massacre.</b> Smart, clear, crisp and
  (gasp) modern. (Michael Hirsch)</p>
  <p>____1916-1922 <b>Carlos Montezuma. <i>Wassaja</i>.</b>
  Montezuma�s newspaper said that missionaries and
  anthropologists--and friends of the Indian--were messing up
  things. He used Socratic dialogue and signed the pieces "Julius,"
  said to be a Bureau of Indian Affairs-governed, but not
  BIA-educated, Indian. (Mark N. Trahant)</p>
  <p>____1919 <b>John Reed. "Ten Days That Shook the World."</b> If
  as Matthew Arnold said "journalism is literature in a hurry,"
  this is a perfect example. (Madeleine Blais) Historians would do
  better. But this was probably the most consequential news story
  of the century, and Reed was there, and Reed could write.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1919 <b>Hugh Fullerton. Black Sox scandal.</b> Fullerton,
  a respected baseball writer, broke it--probably the top sports
  story of the century in this country. Much criticized for his
  early investigations � how dare he make such charges? But he was
  right, and his facts would be used in baseball�s own
  investigations. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1920 <b>Richard Grozier. Investigation of the original
  Ponzi scheme.</b> Grozier led the <i>Boston Post</i>�s crusade to
  uncover one of the largest swindles in American history, that of
  Charles Ponzi, who was one of Boston�s leading figures. <i>The
  Post</i>�s coverage helped to bring down Ponzi, whose name has
  joined the English lexicon. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1921 <b>Herbert Bayard Swope. "Klan Exposed."</b> Swope
  and a battlion of <i>New York World</i> reporters exposed the
  secret and illegal workings of the Klan. Response by the Klan:
  hate letters and a "DEATH ULTIMATUM" sent to the <i>World</i>.
  But the <i>World</i> won a Pulitzer. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1922 <b>Ben Hecht. Series of columns: "1,001 Afternoons in
  Chicago."</b> A masterful writer using a basic journalistic
  form--the column--to explore philosophical limitations and social
  blind spots of journalism. His method: self-criticism, off-path
  wanderings, off-beat wonderings. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1922. <b>William Allen White. "To an Anxious Friend."</b>
  Famous defense of free speech, especially in times of danger.
  Appeared in the <i>Emporia (Kansas) Gazette</i> and was widely
  reprinted throughout the U.S. (David Mindich) Work of the best
  known and most respected of the small-town editors. True moral
  voices "from the heartland" have been few and far between; this
  guy pulled it off. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1923 <b>Samuel D. McCoy. "Crusade to End Florida Peonage
  Evil."</b> <i>New York World</i> reporting on the case of young
  man who was beaten to death by a "whipping boss" in a Florida
  jail. The investigation led to the arrest of the killer and
  Florida�s suspension of whipping in prisons. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1924 <b>Grantland Rice. Notre Dame�s "Four Horsemen"</b>
  Perhaps the most famous lead of all time: "Outlined against a
  blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic
  lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction and Death.
  But these are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher,
  Miller, Crowley and Layden. They formed the crest of the South
  Bend Cyclone before which another Army football team was swept
  over the precipice at the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon as
  55,000 spectators peered down on the bewildering panorama spread
  on the green plain below." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1925 <b>H.L. Mencken. Coverage of the Scopes monkey
  trial.</b> Eviscerated William Jennings Bryant and all who
  admired him. Devastating and effective. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1925 <b>H.L Mencken. "In Memoriam: W.J.B."</b> One of the
  preeminent examples of Mencken�s acerbic criticism. (Lamar
  Graham)</p>
  <p>____1926 <b>Julian LaRose Harris�s <i>Columbus
  Enquirer-Sun</i></b> (smallest daily in Georgia). Crusading
  editorials against Ku Klux Klan, local lynching and laws against
  teaching evolution in public schools. Editorials lose
  subscribers, win Pulitzer. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1926 <b>Damon Runyon. Crime reporting.</b> The style found
  in much American detective fiction can be traced back to here.
  Guys and dolls. Blondes and rubes. No style is more street-wise;
  few have been as intense. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1928 <b>Walter Lippmann. <i>New York World</i> editorial
  dealing with the case of the "Radium Girls."</b> The editorial
  and an accompanying cartoon of the five women before the barred
  doors of justice brought the courts around and helped the "Radium
  Girls" in their case. They also exemplified Lippmann�s ideal of
  the role of the press in social conflict and the difficulties the
  press had in dealing with scientific issues. (William
  Kovarik)</p>
  <p>____1930 <b>H.L Mencken. "Christian Science Technique."</b>
  One of the preeminent examples of Mencken�s acerbic criticism.
  (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1931-34 <b>Dorothy Thompson. Reports on the rise of
  Hitler</b> in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and Harper�s. Early. Prescient.
  Powerful. She travels � checks in, checks out � through a country
  she portrays as already haunted by onrushing villainy and horror:
  "I Saw Hitler." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1935 <b>Heywood Broun. "It Seems to Me: 1925-1935."</b>
  Collected columns. A passion for the underdog. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1936 <b>John Steinbeck. Reports on Okie migrant camp
  life</b> for the <i>San Francisco News</i>. Draws wide attention
  to plight of these farm workers. The basis for "The Grapes of
  Wrath." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1936 <b><i>St-Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. Crusade against
  voter fraud</b> that invalidated 40,000 fraudulent ballots. The
  colorful coverage included photos of abandoned buildings with
  captions such as "56 registered from here." The governor fired
  the entire election board following the newspaper�s exposures.
  (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1936 <b>Robert Capa. Spanish Civil War photos</b> for
  Life. Who can forget Capa�s capturing of the instant of death in
  a Republican solider. The preeminent image of the Spanish Civil
  War. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1937 <b>Herb Morrison. Tearful live report on explosion of
  the Hindenburg</b> for WLS in Chicago. Is there any more famous
  line than "Oh, the humanity" in the history of journalism? (Lamar
  Graham) Hardly objective, but what immediacy and emotion! "Oh!
  Oh! Oh! . . . It�s burst into flames. . . .Get out of the way,
  please. Oh my, this is terrible. . . . It is burning, bursting
  into flames and is falling. . . ." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1937-38 <b>Ernest Hemingway. Journalistic reports on the
  Spanish Civil War.</b> Yes, he cared about trout fishing and bull
  fighting but this was war-- with the fascists! Particularly
  powerful piece: "A New Kind of War." (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1938 <b>Bob Considine. Louis-Schmeling fight column.</b>
  (Paul K. Harral)</p>
  <p>____1939-45 <b>Mollie Painter-Downes. <i>New Yorker</i>
  dispatches from WWII London.</b> Probably second only to Murrow
  in informing the American public about life in London during the
  Blitz. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1940 <b>Edward R. Murrow. "This is London . . ."</b> radio
  reports for CBS on the German bombing of London. Also collected
  in book form. (David Brinkley, Jay Rosen) Still gives people
  chills. (Lamar Graham) Superb eye for sympathetic detail.
  Controlled, understated portraits of courage of Londoners rallies
  support for Allies in U.S. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1940-45 <b>Ernie Pyle. Reports from Europe and the Pacific
  during World War II.</b> His name is synonymous with WWII
  journalism. (Lamar Graham) The GI�s perspective. Detailed. Human.
  Moving. Widely popular. Few made better use of notepad or
  typewriter. (Mitchell Stephens) Especially "The Death of Captain
  Waskow." At the front lines in Italy, Jan. 10, 1944. It�s vivid,
  moving and puts you there. (Gene Roberts) Especially his writing
  about D-Day. (Jay Rosen)</p>
  <p>____1940-50 <b>George Seldes. <i>In Fact</i>.</b> His own
  weekly newsletter exposes "falsehoods in the daily
  press"--including their reluctance, because of advertisers, to
  report on link between cigarettes and cancer. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1941 <b>William Shirer. "Berlin Diary."</b> There is
  absolutely no better book by an American about the rise of the
  Third Reich. A gripping--and harrowing--view from inside Hitler�s
  Germany. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1941 <b>Rebecca Wells. "Black Lamb and Gray Falcon."</b>
  Fifty-odd years after it was written, it remains the best primer
  on the Balkans. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1941 <b>James Agee and Walker Evans. "Let Us Now Praise
  Famous Men."</b> Incomparable poetic evocation in the guise of
  cataloguing, essays, photos and pastiche. Nobody can ever do that
  again--it�s too innocent. (Todd Gitlin) For its prose and for
  visiting the forgotten Americans. (Jay Rosen) The classic go-see
  magazine assignment, rejected by the head office, that liberated
  journalists from the cult of objectivity. The only catch: you
  have to be Agee to pull it off. Opens the way for Mailer and
  Didion to experiment with form and structure. (Anne Matthews)
  Just the photos by Walker Evans. Forgive me, but Agee�s writing
  in this volume is so over the top as to be alienating, so despite
  the usual knee-jerk worship of this volume, I say the photos are
  its true heart and what beautiful, American, narrative-packed
  unforgettable faces we get here. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1941 <b>H.L. Mencken. "Newspaper Days."</b> America�s
  greatest newspaperman in a rare genial mood: an industry memoir
  crossed with a terrific series of How I Got That Story tales.
  (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1943 <b>Joseph Mitchell. "McSorley�s Wonderful
  Saloon."</b> Articles and profiles for the <i>New Yorker</i>. Big
  shots, circus freaks, cranks--Mitchell profiled them all with
  dignity and compassion. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1943 <b>Joseph Mitchell. "The Mohawks in High Steel."</b>
  Has had an enduring shelf life, perhaps because a fierce literary
  sensibility was visited on the real world. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1944 <b>Robert Capa. Ten photographs from D-Day.</b> Capa
  went in with the second wave at Omaha Beach. His pictures--only
  ten survived an over-eager processor back in London--were perhaps
  the only record of one of the modern world�s most important
  moments. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>____1944 <b>Bill Mauldin. Cartoons for <i>Stars and
  Stripes</i>.</b> Critique of army brass outrages Gen. Patton,
  delights "dogface" GIs. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1944 <b>A.J. Liebling. "The Road Back to Paris,"</b>
  Contains Liebling�s World War II reportage, which was
  revolutionary in bringing literary style, humor and humanity to
  war coverage. (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Homer Bigart. Account in the <i>New York
  Herald-Tribune</i> of being over Japan in a bomber when World War
  II came to an end.</b> Lede grabs you. Story puts you there.
  (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Walter Bernstein. "Keep Your Head Down."</b>
  Writings about World War II. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Margaret Bourke-White. Photographs for <i>Life</i>
  magazine following the defeat of Germany.</b> She captures Nazi
  suicides and prisoners at Buchenwald. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>James Agee. Piece on the bombing of Hiroshima.</b>
  "The greatest and most terrible of wars ended this week. . . ." A
  platform for one of <i>Time</i>�s best-known writers to produce
  one of journalism�s most eloquent pieces. (Barrett Seaman)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Hodding Carter, Jr. "Go for Broke."</b> One of a
  series of anti-racism editorials that appeared in Carter�s
  <i>Delta Democrat-Times</i> (Greenville, MS) and won a Pulitzer.
  (Jay Rosen)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Joe Rosenthal. Photograph of Marines raising a
  U.S. flag</b> on Mount Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima.
  Iconic. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1945 <b>Edward R. Murrow. Report of the liberation of
  Buchenwald.</b> This report is one, if not the best, example of
  radio reporting at its finest. Murrow uses superb description of
  what happened there. (Christopher Harper)</p>
  <p>____1945-48 <b>Sam Lacey. Coverage of Jackie Robinson</b> as
  he broke baseball�s color barrier. (Eric Newton)</p>
  <p>____1946 <b>John Hersey. "Hiroshima."</b> (Richard Petrow, Ben
  Yagoda) In its very quietude and the deliberate small scale of
  its scope, this work nevertheless achieves volume and magnitude.
  Poetic, prescient, and respectful of the clash of culture and the
  clash of wills that ushered in the atomic era. (Madeleine Blais)
  The pinnacle of war reporting, the first polished example of the
  nonfiction novel, the beginning of the New Yorker�s power to
  shape the socio-political agenda (Anne Matthews) Originally given
  an entire issue of The New Yorker. Nothing played as large a role
  in awakening Americans to the horrors of nuclear weapons as this
  close-up on the survivors. And the writing has a remarkable, at
  times poetic clarity. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1946 <b>George Orwell. "Politics and the English
  Language."</b> True then, true now. A warning for the journalist
  who gets too close to any agenda (however appealing) or any inner
  circle (ditto). (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1947 <b>A. J. Liebling. "Wayward Pressman."</b> Collection
  of press criticism for <i>The New Yorker.</i> He did it first and
  probably best. Consistently witty, occasionally lyrical.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1947 <b><i>The New Yorker</i>. "<i>The New Yorker</i> Book
  of War Pieces."</b> It wasn�t only A.J. Liebling (see above).
  John Lardner, John Hersey, Walter Bernstein, Daniel Lang, Edmund
  Wilson, E.J. Kahn and Philip Hamburger all contributed to <i>The
  New Yorker</i>�s coverage of the war, which did more than
  anything else to establish it as a serious journalistic magazine.
  (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1949 <b>E. B. White. "Here is New York."</b> E. B. White�s
  beautiful ode to New York. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1949 <b>John Gunther. "Death Be Not Proud: A Memoir."</b>
  What it is to be young, doomed and brave. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1949 <b>Meyer Berger. Report on killings of Howard
  Unruh.</b> This is the story--4,000 words written on
  deadline--that finally wins this legendary <i>New York Times</i>
  feature writer and columnist his Pulitzer. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1949 <b>Aldo Leopold. "A Sand County Almanac."</b> Reports
  from the field, literally: a scientist and professor turns out,
  for obscure wildlife magazines, deceptively low-key pieces
  that--posthumously collected and edited--define modern
  environmental writing, environmental history, environmental
  ethics. (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1949-54 <b>Harrison Salisbury. Reporting from the Soviet
  Union</b> for the <i>New York Times</i>. (Richard Petrow)</p>
  <p>____1950 <b>Herblock. Political cartoons.</b> Herbert Block
  coins term "McCarthyism." Hounds Nixon. Wins three Pulitzers.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1951 <b>Alfred Kazin. "A Walker in the City."</b> An
  academic turns to cultural reporting, and encapsulates the New
  York immigrant experience better than anyone since Jacob Riis.
  (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1952 <b>Lillian Ross. "Picture."</b> This book is why
  Capote�s "In Cold Blood" is <i>arguably</i> the first example of
  literary journalism. (Lamar Graham) This account of the making of
  "The Red Badge of Courage," published sixteen years before "In
  Cold Blood," was truly the first non-fiction novel. (Ben
  Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1953-71 <b>I.F. Stone. <i>I.F. Stone�s Weekly.</i></b> One
  man. Four pages. Substantial if often delayed impact. He read the
  transcripts, uncovered the contradictions and absurdities.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1954 <b>Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly. See It Now
  documentary taking on Senator Joseph McCarthy.</b> (Michael
  Ludlum) Largely responsible for turning the nation against that
  Red-baiter. (Lamar Graham) Rare (unprecedented?) courage by
  network journalists. After Army-McCarthy hearings, probably the
  major blow the Senator took. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1954 <b>Anthony Lewis. Clearing of Abraham Chasanow.</b>
  Lewis received a Pulitzer for articles in the Washington, D.C.,
  <i>Daily News</i> clearing Chasanow, a Navy employee, of being a
  security risk. The Navy later officially called its own actions a
  "grave injustice." (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1954 <b>E.B. White. "The Second Tree From the Corner."</b>
  Fugitive pieces from a writer whose star has fallen considerably
  in the last quarter-century, but whose voice was the one to beat
  in magazine writing from Harding�s time to Kennedy�s. (Anne
  Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1955 <b>Murray Kempton. "Part of Our Times: Some Ruins and
  Monuments of the Thirties."</b> (George Will)</p>
  <p>____1956 <b>A.J. Liebling. "The Sweet Science."</b>
  Journalism�s perpetual nostalgie de la boue/de la banlieue
  conflicts made into literature thanks to Liebling�s immaculate
  prose. Sports writing at its peak. (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1957 <b>Tom and Pat Gish. The weekly <i>Mountain
  Eagle</i></b>, Whitesburg, Kentucky. Attacks on strip mining.
  Paper�s motto: "It Screams!" Boycotts launched against it.
  Offices set on fire. Motto changed to: "It Still Screams!"
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1957 <b>Vance Packard. "The Hidden Persuaders."</b> An
  investigation of advertising and consumerism. His examination of
  the post-war explosion of the consumer ethic in America and its
  exploitation by Madison Avenue. Of particular interest was his
  discussion of subliminal advertising which, it�s safe to say,
  most Americans were unaware of at the time. (Michael Ludlum)</p>
  <p>____1958 <b>Ralph McGill. "One Church, One School."</b> (Jay
  Rosen) McGill�s editorial in the Atlanta Constitution was a
  forceful statement against southern violence during the Civil
  Rights movement. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1959 <b>Martha Gellhorn. "The Face of War."</b> Gellhorn,
  who died in 1998, covered wars from the 1930s (the Spanish Civil
  War) to the 1980s (the invasion of Panama), and her work stands
  up better than that of the man she was briefly married to, Ernest
  Hemingway. (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1959 <b>James Baldwin. "Letter from the South: Nobody
  Knows My Name."</b> In the <i>Partisan Review</i>. Charged,
  crucial subject. Hot, humid prose. He was there early, and he was
  there in force. Few works of journalism grab so hard. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1960 <b>Robert Drew, Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker.
  "Primary."</b> Early cinema verite documentary on Kennedy�s
  primary run. Camera follows Kennedy around in cars and
  receptions. Groundbreaking style and coverage of a campaign.
  (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1960 <b>Joseph Mitchell. "The Bottom of the Harbor."</b>
  Another lovely writer whose prose has become totemic for
  ambitious journalists: the long opening paragraph of �The
  Rivermen� ("I often feel drawn to the Hudson River, and I have
  spent a lot of time through the years poking around the part of
  it that flows past the city. I never get tired of looking at it;
  it hypnotizes me. I like to look at it in midsummer, when it is
  warm and dirty and drowsy, and I like to look at it in January,
  when it is carrying ice...") bedevils just about any reporter who
  cares about style. Mitchell is what every journalist wants to be,
  and also what every journalist ought to fear becoming: a
  wonderful writer who first deliberately erases the fact-fiction
  border . . . then falls silent for decades. (Anne Matthews)</p>
  <p>____1960 <b>Edward R. Murrow, David Lowe and Fred Friendly.
  CBS Reports documentary "Harvest of Shame."</b> (Michael Ludlum,
  Jay Rosen) The moment when TV documentary and film production
  came together. Perfect writing to picture. Story of migrant
  workers. (Marcia Rock) Expose of the condition of migrant farm
  workers in the United States. Writing that you don�t get anymore.
  Shots that they don�t hold anymore. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1961 <b>Theodore White�s "The Making of the President
  1960."</b> This groundbreaking book told the story of the
  presidential election in a way that had never been done before,
  and it has served as the model for presidential journalism ever
  since. It treated the election as a long quest by individuals,
  complete with discussions of personal character, "inside
  baseball" discussions of political machines and candidate
  strategy, and a novelistic attention to detail. It is <i>sui
  generis;</i> the Pulitzer Prize committee created a special
  category in order to honor it. (Jon Enriquez) A revelation, at
  the time. Took the public one large step closer to politicians.
  Not his fault if we haven�t always liked what we have seen there
  since. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1961 <b>A.J. Liebling. "The Earl of Louisiana."</b>
  Classic portrayal of Earl Long. (Gene Roberts) A political primer
  written with great style that is the harbinger of all great
  reporting about men in power and the twin lures of corruption and
  abuse. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1962 <b>Rachel Carson. "Silent Spring."</b> (David
  Brinkley, Richard Petrow, Ben Yagoda) Felicitously brought
  together and popularized ideas that were in the air, and sparked
  one of the major social movements of our era. (Ellen Willis) It
  represents an exhaustive research effort, compelling reporting of
  the findings, and a pivotal moment in communication with the
  general public on a matter of policy. I cannot imagine a more
  appropriate example of the function of a work of journalism.
  (Priscilla Coit Murphy) A rather large political movement was
  spawned by this work. (Mitchell Stephens) Carson�s book, an
  expose of the environmental consequences of DDT, is a classic of
  environmental reporting and provided a vital impetus to the
  founding of the environmental activist movement. (Stephen
  Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1962-75 <b>Peter Arnett. AP dispatches from Vietnam.</b> I
  don�t think anyone captured the soldier�s-eye view of Vietnam
  better. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Murray Kempton. "America Comes of Middle Age:
  Columns 1950-1962."</b> (Richard Petrow, George Will)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Hazel Brannon Smith. "Through Hazel�s Eyes."</b>
  Smith became the first female winner of the Pulitzer prize
  because of her "steadfast adherence to her editorial duty in the
  face of great pressure and opposition." In her editorials for the
  <i>Lexington (Miss.) Advertiser,</i> she tirelessly criticized
  extremists and southern lawmakers. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather. Live coverage of
  the JFK assassination.</b> I was born after JFK�s murder, but I
  remain haunted by the footage of Cronkite and Rather bringing the
  news to the nation. I�ve never seen more emotional reporting.
  (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Terry Southern. "Twirling at Ole Miss."</b>
  Classic �60s "underground" journalism. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>John Hershey. "Here To Stay."</b> An anthology of
  his <i>New Yorker</i> pieces, built around the theme of man�s
  determination to survive, even at times and places (concentration
  camps in World War II, for example) when life was at its worst.
  The collection includes "Hiroshima" and much else that is
  stunning. (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Robert Drew. "Crisis: Behind a Presidential
  Commitment."</b> Behind-the-scenes documentary aired on CBS shows
  President John F. Kennedy and staff as they out-manuver Governor
  George Wallace and desegregate the University of Alabama. (Mary
  Sisson)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>James Baldwin. "The Fire Next Time."</b> An
  anguished call to arms by one black writer battling the horrors
  of racism in America. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1963 <b>Betty Friedan. "The Feminine Mystique."</b>
  Felicitously brought together and popularized ideas that were in
  the air, and sparked one of the major social movements of our
  era. (Ellen Willis)</p>
  <p>____1963-72 <b>Gene Miller. Reporting that lead to the
  acquittal of two men on death row.</b> In 1963, two white gas
  station attendants were shot to death in Port St. Joe, Florida.
  Two black men, Freddie Pitts and Wilbert Lee, were beaten and
  forced to confess to the crime. Four years later, another man
  confessed, and a Miami Herald reporter, Gene Miller, spent eight
  and a half years investigating and then trying to free the two
  men. Finally, with the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the
  men were pardoned by Florida�s governor. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1964 <b>Susan Sontag. "Notes on Camp."</b> Its unusual
  form accomplished what the author wanted: it succeeded in the
  difficult task of pinning down a sensibility, so much so that our
  view of the phenomena collectively known as camp will be forever
  filtered through this essay. (Madeleine Blais) Groundbreaking
  intellectual journalism. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1964 <b>Lillian Ross. "Reporting."</b> <i>The New
  Yorker</i> profile reaches an apotheosis in the marvelous
  collection that demonstrates once and for all that great
  journalsim is in the details, whether describing a beauty
  pageant, a high school class trip, the making of a movie, or a
  great wirter (Hemingway) with a tendency to preen and
  pontificate. The Hemingway piece alone could stand as a single
  nominee. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1964-77 <b>Eric Sevareid. Commentary and analysis
  pieces</b> aired on the CBS Evening News with Walker Cronkite.
  (Michael Ludlum)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Morley Safer. Report for CBS on atrocities
  committed by American soldiers on the hamlet of Cam Ne in
  Vietnam.</b> CBS officials didn�t want to air this story. But
  Safer had film. President Lyndon Johnson wakes CBS�s president to
  protest. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>John McPhee. "A Sense of Where You Are."</b> The
  book written from his <i>New Yorker</i> piece on Bill Bradley.
  (Gene Roberts) McPhee�s profile of Bill Bradley, the Princeton
  basketball player, was his first major story for The New Yorker
  and represents well his gift for detail, observation, and
  phrasing. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Truman Capote. "In Cold Blood."</b> A meticulous
  work of sociology, psychology, legal studies, and literature. The
  standard bearer for a certain kind of true crime journalism.
  Probably my top candidates for a time capsule to be opened at the
  end of the next millenium. (Madeleine Blais) No one had ever
  engaged in a process of journalistic reconstruction on this scale
  before Capote. That he played fast and loose with the facts in
  some passages was the fault of the author, not his method. (Ben
  Yagoda) An absolute classic--and one of the first great examples
  of so-called literary journalism (Capote would say <i>the</i>
  first example). (Lamar Graham) Capote�s chilling and detailed
  account of the murder of a Kansas family and the lives of their
  killers. Genre establishing. (Mitchell Stephens) A tour de force
  of crime writing, In Cold Blood became a pioneer of literary
  journalism. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Joseph Mitchell. "Joe Gould�s Secret."</b>
  Mitchell was the dean of literary journalism, and this incredibly
  subtle portrait of a Greenwich Village charlatan was his
  masterpiece. (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Malcolm X and Alex Haley. "The Autobiography of
  Malcolm X."</b> Seems to me part of an on-going colloquy about
  the very nature of racism and its evil manifestations. Goes
  nuclear, but has an integrity and on-going freshness that makes
  it as important today as when it was published. (Madeleine
  Blais)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Tom Wolfe. "The Kandy-Kolored, Tangerine-Flake
  Streamline Baby."</b> Wolfe is a great New Journalist but also
  the most important and influential cultural reporter/polemicist
  to come out of the 60s. In the pieces that make up the book, he
  not only chronicles in miraculous detail the emergence of new
  cultural forms from the "vinyl deeps"; he invents a style and
  rhetoric that owes as much to advertising as to literature and
  conveys through its energy and exuberance the spirit of those new
  forms and of American mass culture in general; and he effectively
  champions that culture against the near-universal contempt of the
  intellectual establishment of the day. (Ellen Willis) The</p>
  <p>first and best collection by a writer who is, in my mind, our
  greatest living critic of status, manners and mores. Others will
  object, but I think he�s modern America�s Balzac. (Lamar
  Graham)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Tom Wolfe. "The Last American Hero."</b> The saga
  of Junior Johnson, the stock car racing driver. (Gene
  Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>Lennart Nilsson. Photo spread showing six-week-old
  human embryo.</b> In <i>Life.</i> Look at the previously unseen.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1965 <b>George Plimpton. "Paper Lion."</b> (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1966 <b>Ralph Nader. "Unsafe at any Speed."</b> Nader�s
  expose of the built-in safety deficiencies of the General Motors
  Corvair rang the starting bell for a major consumer movement in
  the United States. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1966 <b>Gay Talese. "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold."</b> Like a
  shimmering short story, this compact, resonant piece shows how
  the "artful glimpse" (William Trevor�s words) can often evoke a
  stunning panorama. Economy, economy, economy of detail and vision
  create a wealth, wealth, wealth. (Madeleine Blais) The
  prototype--and paragon--of the modern celebrity profile. Current
  efforts all pale by comparison. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1966 <b>H.D. Quigg. UPI Sunday reprise of Charles Joseph
  Whitman�s shooting from a bell tower</b> on the University of
  Texas campus. A very early example of tick-tock journalism and
  very well done. (Paul Harral)</p>
  <p>____1966 <b>Jean Stafford. "A Woman in History."</b> Same
  comment as for Joseph Mitchell on "Mohawks in High Steel": Has
  had an enduring shelf life, perhaps because a fierce literary
  sensibility was visited on the real world. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1966 <b>Studs Terkel. "Division Street: America."</b> His
  first book, the one in which he invented his form. Romantic in
  the Chicago tradition of Sandburg and Dreiser, but impressive.
  (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1967. <b>Nick Kotz. Bad Meat.</b> Reported on unsanitary
  conditions in the meat-packing industry for the <i>Des Moines
  Register</i>. His findings, including the disclosure of a 1962
  government report, led to the passage of the Federal Wholesome
  Meat Act of 1967. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b>John McPhee. "Oranges."</b> Fine example of what
  McPhee does: connect, explore, get close, closer, closest. And of
  course the writing sings. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b>J. Anthony Lukas. "The Two Worlds of Linda
  Fitzpatrick."</b> In the New York Times. (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b><i>Riverside (Ca.) Press-Enterprise</i>.
  Uncovering corruption in handling Indian estates.</b> The
  investigation led to convictions and clsoer monitoring of these
  estates by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Pulitzer 1968. (David
  Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b>Frederick Wiseman. "Titicut Follies."</b>
  Documentary of life in a mental hospital. The ultimate
  cinema-verite style/fly-on-the-wall style documentary. Wiseman
  shoots hours of footage and then edits it down with no narration.
  (Marcia Rock) The texture of everyday life in institutions. (Todd
  Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b>John Sack. "M."</b> I don�t think anyone captured
  the soldier�s-eye view of Vietnam better. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1967 <b>D.A. Pennebaker. "Don�t Look Back."</b> The 1965
  Dylan tour of England. A pungent revelation of "attitude" before
  there was a name or an institution for it. Catches the hysteria
  of youth culture, and the excitement of it. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Frederick Wiseman. "High School."</b> The texture
  of everyday life in institutions. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Tom Wolfe. "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."</b> By
  far the best book written about the 60s counterculture; yet it
  transcends its immediate subject matter to illuminate larger
  themes of religious experience and American myth-making. Wolfe
  combines his usual virtuoso reporting with an uncanny ability to
  articulate an experience whose fundamental power is beyond words;
  and in recounting the Pranksters� spiritual quest he manages to
  combine unfailing empathy with unfailing critical distance.
  (Ellen Willis) I frankly don�t know how much of a recreation this
  is, but it feels fundamentally true to me (and I�ve never seen
  its truth contested). (Todd Gitlin) Here, Wolfe takes Capote�s
  innovation in narrative journalism and supercharges it. A piece
  of pure journalistic performance. (Ben Yagoda) If one of the
  purposes of journalism is to help us enter new worlds, Wolfe did
  it as well here as it has ever been done. He got something very
  bizarre, but very influential, very right. And the writing itself
  is also eye-opening. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Gary Wills. "Martin Luther King Is Still on the
  Case."</b> From <i>Esquire</i>. One of the great magazine pieces
  from the civil rights movement. Maybe <i>the</i> great. (Lamar
  Graham)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Walter Cronkite. Documentary on Vietnam.</b>
  (Michael Ludlum, Richard Petrow) An important moment in
  journalism history. Today, it still provokes much analysis. Did
  it influence Lyndon Johnson�s bombshell decision in March to
  reject another run for the presidency? Did it influence American
  public opinion or did it more accurately reflect growing antiwar
  sentiment? (Garry Gilbert) This CBS broadcast convinced President
  Johnson that he had lost the country. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Joan Didion. "Slouching Towards Bethlehem"
  (collected essays).</b> Having apparently received a transfusion
  of DNA from Montaigne at birth, Didion went on to become a master
  of the kind of sentence with rises and falls with surprising
  fillips and grand finales that qualify as a kind of music. Marry
  this grand style with her down-to-earth subject matter and the
  union is unforgettable. (Madeleine Blais) A good chunk of the
  �60s in one slim book. (Lamar Graham) For seeing the dark side of
  the 60s and forecasting the culture wars of today. (Jay Rosen) A
  collection of her searching, often nasty, often lovely cultural
  excursions. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Albert and David Maysles. "Salesman."</b> Bible
  salesmen. Cinema verite style where filmmakers go walking with
  the salesmen. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Norman Mailer. "The Armies of the Night."</b>
  (Todd Gitlin, Ellen Willis) When everyone else was discovering
  the first person, Mailer was discovering the third, in this tour
  de force of neo-Victorian prose. (Ben Yagoda) For great writing
  in the participant/observer mode. Will stand the test of time.
  (Jay Rosen) Is there a better book about the anti-war movement of
  the �60s? (Lamar Graham) Packed tight with observations,
  revelations, thoughts. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1968 <b>Eddie Adams and Vo Suu. Photograph of a Saigon
  execution.</b> An AP photographer and an NBC cameraman both
  captured the summary execution of a Viet Cong guerrilla by a
  South Vietnamese general during the Tet offensive. The image that
  probably did most to turn the public against the war. (Mitchell
  Stephens) Along with that pic of a little girl running naked down
  a road after a napalm attack, Adams� image of an ARVN general
  blowing away his prisoner is arguably the most recognizable image
  of the war in Viet Nam. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1969 <b>Joe McGinniss. The Selling of the Presidency,
  1968.</b> McGinniss conveys an inside view of the marketing of a
  presidential candidate, Richard Nixon, to the American voters.
  The revelations might well evince a yawn today, but 30 years ago
  it was an eye-opener--and a first. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1969 <b>Seymour Hersh. Investigation of massacre committed
  by American soldiers at My Lai</b> in Vietnam. (Richard Petrow)
  What other story brought home the horror of Vietnam better?
  (Lamar Graham) One reporter; unaffiliated; unable, originally, to
  sell the story to the mainstream media. But he got it right; the
  mainstream belatedly followed. Among the loudest of the questions
  raised about the American war effort. (Mitchell Stephens) Hersh
  uncovered a massacre perpetrated by American troops against
  Vietnamese civilians. His painstaking investigation was a factor
  in turning American attitudes against the war. (Stephen
  Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1969 <b>D.A. Pennebaker. "Monterey Pop."</b> Rock
  innocence, excitement before the rock culture became so jaded.
  (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1969 <b>Pauline Kael. "Trash, Art, and the Movies."</b>
  Eloquent argument declaring the independence of movies from the
  tyranny of "art" defined as what the authorities say is good for
  you and opting instead for a conception of popular art? trash?
  whatever valued for its compex and various contributions to the
  audience�s pleasure and the heightening and intensification of
  experience. In resisting the "auteur theory" and its attempt to
  coopt movies into the ranks of high culture, Kael�s work in
  general, and this piece in particular, were insturmential in
  articulating an aesthetic of mass culture as having its own
  distinctive properties and virtues, and had a powerful influence
  on younger cultural critics. (Ellen Willis)</p>
  <p>____1969 <b>Walter Cronkite. Coverage of the space flight that
  put a man on the moon.</b> Cronkite�s preparation was extensive
  and it showed. He provided knowledgeable insights on the
  astronauts and the technology involved. His reporting style
  complemented the significance and drama of the occasion without
  intruding on its innate newsworthiness. (Michael Ludlum)</p>
  <p>____1970 <b>William Jones. "Sadism Rides an Ambulance."</b>
  Reports in the Chicago Tribune of awful brutality by an ambulance
  driver of his charges. Jones went undercover as an ambulance
  worker himself and exposed such things as making a heart attack
  victim walk to her stretcher. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1970 <b>Gay Talese. "Fame and Obscurity: Portraits by Gay
  Talese</b> Contains a large chunk of what I consider his best
  work, including his 1964 book "The Bridge," on the construction
  of the Verrazano, and his classic profiles of Frank Sinatra, Joe
  DiMaggio, and Joe Louis. One of the two (the other being Tom
  Wolfe) most influential New Journalists, creating a genre of
  literary journalism that combines the use of novelistic
  techniques with in-depth saturation reporting. Along with Wolfe,
  is dedicated to showing that reporting is a conscious aesthetic
  endeavor, not a mechanical conveyor belt between fact and reader.
  A master of nuanced, mind-bogglingly thorough observation,
  narrative reconstruction of events, and depiction of character
  through the revelatory scene, action, piece of dialogue. (Ellen
  Willis) Few have gotten more from scenes; legwork; polished,
  formal writing. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1970 <b>Hunter S. Thompson. "The Kentucky Derby Is
  Decadent and Depraved."</b> The piece in which he establishes his
  inverted but oddly effective variety of journalism: unleashing
  fantasy in search of truth. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1970 <b>Tom Wolfe. "Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak
  Catchers."</b> (Todd Gitlin) Energetic and iconoclastic, this
  essay remains a standard bearer for the New Journalism.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1971 <b><i>New York Times</i>. Publication of the Pentagon
  Papers.</b> The Nixon administration tried to block the <i>New
  York Times</i> from printing the papers, but the United States
  Supreme Court ruled that the government may not exercise "prior
  restraint." (David Mindich) Publication of the Pentagon Papers
  precipitated a prior restraint against the <i>Times</i> and the
  <i>Post</i> and a landmark Supreme Court decision on the rights
  of the press. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1971 <b>Jon Nordheimer "From Dakto to Detroit: death of a
  Troubled Hero."</b> Brilliant, under-reprinted account in <i>New
  York Times</i> of a black Congressional Medal of Honor winner
  (Vietnam) who was killed while trying to rob a grocery store.
  (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1971-99 <b>Bill Moyers. "Bill Moyers Journal."</b> Series
  of programs bringing intelligence and a nuanced understanding of
  American life to TV. (Richard Petrow)</p>
  <p>____1971 <b>Peter Davis. "The Selling of the Pentagon."</b>
  CBS News documentary. (Marcia Rock) Few network television
  documentaries have had the courage to investigate the government,
  let alone the Pentagon; few have succeeded in shaking things up.
  This one did. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1971 <b>Norman Mailer. "Of a Fire on the Moon."</b> What
  can you say? He goes to the core. When the subject is right, his
  subjectivity transcends itself. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1972 <b>Huyn Cong Ut. Photograph of a burning girl running
  from a napalm attack.</b> Unforgettable image. The horror of war,
  this war. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1972 <b>Timothy Crouse. "Boys on the Bus."</b> Reporting
  on reporters. No one has done it better. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1972 <b>Roger Kahn. "Boys of Summer."</b> The afterlife of
  athletes, beautifully told. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1972-73 <b>Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Watergate
  investigations</b> for the <i>Washington Post</i>. (Jay Rosen)
  And the president resigned. (Mitchell Stephens) Can we even
  conceive of what�s happening to Clinton had it not been for what
  happened to Nixon? (Lamar Graham) The Woodward and Bernstein
  pieces are an example of investigative reporting at its very
  best, a standard by which all other efforts are measured. The
  <i>Post</i> articles unraveled the Watergate scandal and brought
  down Richard Nixon�s presidency. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1973 <b>Hunter S. Thompson. "Fear and Loathing on the
  Campaign Trail."</b> The cacophony of a presidential
  campaign�with the volume turned up. He found a kind of truth
  amidst the madness, through the madness. (Mitchell Stephens) You
  can�t talk about �60s/�70s journalism without talking about
  Thompson, and this work collects his best (even though I
  personally prefer "Hell�s Angels"). (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1973 <b>Joe Esztherhas. "Charlie Simpson�s
  Apocalypse."</b> Originally published in <i>Rolling Stone</i>.
  Arguably the story that put that magazine on the map as a
  journalistic vehicle. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1973 <b>Robert Christgau. "Any Old Way You Choose It."</b>
  This pioneering collection of <i>Esquire, Voice</i> and
  <i>Newsday</i> essays and reviews on pop music never got the
  attention it deserves; it is now out of print and not even in the
  NYU library. The articles it consists of, however, have had an
  enormous impact, not only in shaping a new critical genre--pop
  music criticism--but by introducing into cultural journalism, in
  lucid and passionate prose, many of the insights about the
  dissolving boundaries between art and life later recycled by the
  academy, couched in impenetrable jargon, and labeled
  "postmodernism." (Ellen Willis)</p>
  <p>____1973 <b>Don Bartlett and James B. Steele. "Oil: The
  Created Crisis."</b> The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. Arguably
  their best. So out in front of the story that acclaim came mostly
  a year after they wrote the series and too late for a Pulitzer.
  (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1974 <b>Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. "All the
  President�s Men."</b> (Lamar Graham) As much as this book is
  about government and power and its temptations, it is also about
  reporting and power and its temptations. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1975 <b>Nora Ephron. "Crazy Salad."</b> Women�s lives and
  traditional housewife culture exposed with great wit. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1975 <b>Frederick Wiseman. "Welfare."</b> The texture of
  everyday life in institutions. (Todd Gitlin) This documentary,
  broadcast on PBS, was cinema verite at its most powerful.
  Activities inside a New York City welfare office in remarkably
  tight focus. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1975 <b>Peter Davis. "Hearts and Minds."</b> (Marcia
  Rock)</p>
  <p>____1975 <b>Greil Marcus. "Mystery Train."</b> The definitive
  exploration of rock and roll as American culture�or rather the
  American drama acted out by its rock and roll
  performers�particularly the tour de force of its last chapter,
  "Presliad." Its prose, as I wrote in my New Yorker review, by
  turns "attains an elegiac eloquence that echoes the blues" and is
  "pure effluvium of pop, crammed with digressions and
  amplifications and throwaway insights and the endless bits of
  information a fan can�t bear to leave out." (Ellen Willis)</p>
  <p>____1976 <b>Karen Durbin. "On Being a Woman Alone."</b>
  Durbin�s groundbreaking personal essays in the <i>Village
  Voice</i> are early models of a genre of female memoir that has
  since become fashionable (and too often formulaic). She was
  relentlessly attacked for being "confessional" and "narcissistic"
  and writing about her lovers. But for her admirers, including me,
  her work is notable for its honesty, lack of sentimentality, and
  fidelity to the ambiguity and complexity of real messy life, as
  well as a feminist politics that emphasizes freedom�material,
  sexual and emotional. Her moments of illumination are always
  earned, never contrived, nor do they ever pretend to ultimately
  settle anything. This one in my view is her best. (Ellen
  Willis)</p>
  <p>____1976 <b>C.B.D. Bryan. "Friendly Fire."</b> A book that has
  the same impact as the Viet Nam Memorial in Washington. It is as
  elegant and solid, as well. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1977 <b>John McPhee. "The John McPhee Reader."</b>
  (Richard Petrow) No one McPhee work stands out above the others,
  but he deserves to be on the list because of his reportorial
  creativity, his structural ingenuity and his understated humor.
  This is a marvelous anthology from his best period. (Ben
  Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1977 <b>Alan and Susan Raymond. "Police Tapes."</b> Cinema
  verite style documentary that presages 48 Hours and other reality
  programs that put the camera on the shoulder and went riding with
  cops. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1977 <b>Philip Caputo. "Rumor of War."</b> This is one of
  the most subtle, moving, frustrating and beautiful memoirs of men
  at war ever written. It captures all the hope that went into the
  war and all the despair that emerged in uncompromising prose.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1977 <b>Michael Herr. "Dispatches."</b> Poetic and
  mundane, this work captures the essential contradictory nature of
  our involvement in Vietnam. (Madeleine Blais) Writing so powerful
  it takes your breath away. The classic book of Vietnam
  journalism. (Ben Yagoda) The one book from the new journalism
  that will always stand up as factual observation using the style
  of fiction. (Jay Rosen) The single most compelling book about</p>
  <p>Vietnam ever written, in my opinion. (Lamar Graham) Jumpy,
  haunted and shattering�like some rock music, like this war.
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1978 <b>Gaylord Shaw. "Dams: A Question of Safety"</b>
  series for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Shaw�s articles led to a
  huge federal investigation of dams nationwide. (David
  Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1978 <b>Errol Morris. "Gates of Heaven."</b> The pet
  cemetery and people who care about it. Amazing Americana,
  respectful of crankiness. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong.</b> "<b>The
  Brethren."</b> This was an extensive inside look at how the U.S.
  Supreme Court operates. Significantly, the book illuminated the
  inner workings of one of our three branches of government that
  until then had been closed to view. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Ira Wohl. "Best Boy."</b> (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Dave and Cathy Mitchell. Reporting on Synanon.</b>
  Two reporters who had recently bought a small California paper,
  the <i>Point Reyes Light,</i> undertook an investigation that
  uncovered the bizarre dealings of a nearby cult, Synanon. Their
  efforts won them a Pulitzer. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Michele Wallace. "Black Macho and the Myth of
  Superwoman."</b> Book at first so vilified by its intended
  beneficiaries that you knew it had to be hitting a nerve. Started
  a debate on race and feminism that has never stopped. Every black
  feminist from bell hooks to Lisa Jones bears her imprint. (Ellen
  Willis)</p>

  Shurkin, et. al. The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>�s
  reconstruction of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.</b>
  (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Hunter S. Thompson. "The Great Shark Hunt."</b>
  You can�t talk about �60s/�70s journalism without talking about
  Thompson, and this is a second work that collects his best (Lamar
  Graham)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Tom Wolfe. "The Right Stuff."</b> (Gene Roberts)
  Another tight, insular culture opened, with great style and
  humor. (Mitchell Stephens) Stylish and well written, this is the
  best there is about space and the fighter jocks who took us
  there. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1979 <b>Norman Mailer. "The Executioner�s Song."</b> A
  meticulous work of sociology, psychology, legal studies, and
  literature. The standard bearer for a certain kind of true crime
  journalism. Among my top candidates for a time capsule to be
  opened at the end of the next millenium. (Madeleine Blais) The
  first half of this book settles as deeply into the language of
  strangers as any work of nonfiction I have read. (Mitchell
  Stephens)</p>

  brilliant essay by one of our great contrarians. (Michael
  Ludlum)</p>
  <p>____1981 <b>Pierre Salinger. "America Held Hostage: The Secret
  Negotiations."</b> ABC documentary provided significant insight
  into what had gone on behind the scenes during the Iranian
  hostage crisis. (Christopher Harper)</p>
  <p>____1981 <b>Tracy Kidder. "The Soul of a New Machine."</b>
  Technology made human (and for some, therefore all the more
  terrifying) in an elegant prose style. (Madeleine Blais) Early
  journalism about the computer. Clear and compelling about the
  complex. Unfortunately this particular computer soon became an
  outdated machine. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1981-85 <b>Randy Shilts. Reporting on AIDS.</b> Shilts was
  one of the only reporters in the country to report on emerging
  AIDS crisis. Through his reports in the <i>San Francisco
  Chronicle,</i> bathhouses were closed and health authorities were
  forced to confront the epidemic. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1982 <b>Loren Jenkens. Coverage of the massacre at the
  Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps</b> in Lebanon. The
  <i>Washington Post</i>�s Jenkens shared the Pulitzer with Tom
  Friedman of the <i>New York Times,</i> but the <i>Post</i>�s
  coverage was much better. (Christopher Harper)</p>
  <p>____1982 <b>Susan Sheehan. "Is There No Place on Earth for
  Me?"</b> By telling the story of a mental patient by the name of
  Sylvia Frumpkin in a torrent of detail, the relentlessness of her
  disease and the inadequacy of the people charged with her care
  remains a stunning example of how even the most marginal life is
  filled with significance if only we are prepared to use our eyes
  and heart to see. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1982 <b>Russell Baker. "Growing Up."</b> Wry,
  self-deprecating, this story of a family trying to survive during
  the Depression is also a psalm to newspapers and everything they
  used to represent when print was king. The chapter of the
  correspondence between Baker�s widowed mother and the German
  baker is a great archive in and of itself. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1982 <b>Roger Rosenblatt. "Children of War."</b> Time
  cover story. Combined great reporting and writing with the best
  of photojournalism. (Barrett Seaman)</p>
  <p>____1982 <b>Jayne Loader and Kevine and Pierce Rafferty.
  "Atomic Cafe."</b> Clips from the 50s describing the hysteria
  aroused by the bomb. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1984 <b>Michael Apted. "28 Up."</b> (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1985 <b>Ted Koppel. "Nightline" (ABC) broadcast from South
  Africa.</b> The first time the white government ever engaged
  black South Africans in public discussion. Koppel was making
  history, and using television journalism to do it. (Jay
  Rosen)</p>
  <p>____1985 <b>ABC. Coverage of the hijacking of TWA 847.</b> The
  tarmac interview of Capt. John Testrake reamins one of the most
  memorable images in recent years. Also, this coverage was one of
  the few examples of the media serving as a means of communication
  between terrorists and government officials. In part of the ABC
  coverage, only one person died in what was a delicate diplomatic
  situation. (Christopher Harper)</p>
  <p>____1985 <b>J.</b> <b>Anthony Lukas. "Common Ground: A
  Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families."</b>
  (Gene Roberts) Tackles the most divisive issues of our time--race
  and class--in a reportorial format. (Jay Rosen) Like "The
  Executioner�s Song," this book defies boundaries of history and
  sociology and urban studies to create its own new category. Using
  the prism of three families, Lukas cuts back and forth in the
  present and the past to show how a current event, the busing
  crisis in Boston in the early seventies, has clear and tragic
  roots in the imprisoning past. (Madeleine Blais) A great and
  powerful work of journalism, derived using the classic methods of
  journalism (extensive interviews and observation, along with
  background research), but a work that also has become an
  important work of history, even though the events it describes
  were in the very recent past when Lukas wrote about them. Through
  the lives of three Boston families, Lukas reveals the complexity
  and the depth of anguish that the busing crisis of the 1970s
  created, and that the social problems that busing was trying to
  address also created. (Alan Brinkley)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>Tim O�Brien. "The Things We Carry."</b> Goes
  through objects (wasn�t it Wallace Stephens who said "No ideas
  but in things?") of a homely and sentimental nature to show us
  the conflict not just in the jungle and the rice paddies but
  inside the minds and hearts of our fighting men in Viet Nam.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>Ross McElwee. "Sherman�s March."</b> A personal
  documentary that uses Sherman�s path to retrace his own family
  history. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>Steve Twomey. "How Super Are Our
  Supercarriers?"</b> Appeared in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer
  Magazine</i>. Awesome story movement and description. (Gene
  Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>Sally Tisdale. "We Do Abortions Here."</b>
  Appeared in <i>Harper�s.</i></p>
  <p>Confronts, with grace but without flinching, emotions
  surrounding the act of abortion. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>Bill Moyers. "The Vanishing Family--Crisis in
  Black America."</b> Moyers explores the break-down of the black
  family. His interviews with teen moms and dads are superb. DuPont
  Silver Baton. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1986 <b>David Shipler. "Arab and Jew."</b> (Richard
  Petrow)</p>
  <p>____1987 <b>James Gleiek. "Chaos: Making a New Science."</b>
  Announced the arrival of a new science remarkably early and
  sufficiently loudly and clearly that that announcement continues
  to reverberate. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1987 <b>Henry Hampton. "Eyes on the Prize."</b> Marvelous
  choice of film sequences, talking hears (e.g. the Little Rock
  high school integrators, now middle-aged and articulate. The
  second sequence falls down (too uncritical of the Black
  Panthers), but the first eight episodes or so are superb. (Todd
  Gitlin) Dramatic and moving account of the civil rights movement.
  A great work of journalism. (Pamela Newkirk)</p>
  <p>____1987 <b>Sylvester Monroe and Peter Goldman.
  "Brothers."</b> In <i>Newsweek</i>. A fascinating look at
  Monroe�s old ghetto neighborhood in Chicago and what had happened
  to his old friends. (Christopher Harper)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>Ted Koppel. "Nightline" (ABC) broadcast from
  Israel.</b> Koppel and company got Israeli and Palestinian
  leaders together for the first time ever in a public forum.
  Koppel was making history, and using television journalism to do
  it. (Jay Rosen)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>Errol Morris. "The Thin Blue Line."</b> Amazing
  use of interviews and music to explore the question of what
  actually happened in a Texas murder. (Todd Gitlin) Morris�s best.
  (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>P.J. O�Rourke. "Holidays in Hell."</b> Travel
  writing turned upside-down. "When the kid in the front row at the
  rally bit off the tip of his little finger and wrote, KIM DAE
  JUNG, in blood on his fancy white ski jacket--I think that was
  the first time I ever really felt like a foreign correspondent. I
  mean, here was something really fucking <i>foreign</i>." (Mary
  Sisson)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>Don Barlett and James B. Steele. "The Great Tax
  Giveaway"</b> series for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. Won
  the Pulitzer for national reporting. (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>Taylor Branch. "Parting the Waters."</b> The
  history of the civil-rights struggle is all here, and more.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>Neil Sheehan. "A Bright Shining Lie."</b> Sheehan
  brilliantly reconstructs the tragic life of one of the most
  illuminating figures of the Vietnam War, and in the process
  exposes--through the medium of a powerfully narrated story--many
  of the most basic problems and issues of that war. Sheehan�s book
  is, of course, of historical importance, but it is at heart a
  work of journalism, derived largely from Sheehan�s own
  experiences in Vietnam and from extensive interviews with others.
  (Alan Brinkley)</p>
  <p>____1988 <b>David Remnick. "In Spitak, Survivors Comb Ruins of
  Devastated Town."</b> News reporting for the <i>Washington
  Post</i>. (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1989 <b>Thomas Friedman. "From Beirut to Jerusalem."</b>
  (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1989 <b>Ian Frazier. "Great Plains."</b> Frazier�s profile
  of a much-traveled-over piece of America makes quirkiness into an
  art form. (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1989 <b>Marlon Riggs. "Tongues Untied."</b> Deliberately
  scadalous symphony of revelation about a gay black man. Inventive
  and funny. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1989 <b><i>Time</i>. "The Endangered Earth" issue.</b> A
  variation of <i>Time</i>�s traditional Man of the Year.
  Dramatically presented, it offered a troubling diagnosis of the
  planet�s environmental condition. (Barrett Seaman)</p>
  <p>____1990 <b>Timothy Garton Ash. "The Magic Lantern."</b>
  Reports on the velvet revolutions in Prague and Eastern Europe
  for the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. This book collects the
  best of those pieces. One of the decisive dates of the century,
  the year 1989, is brilliantly chronicled here. (Jay Rosen)</p>
  <p>____1991 <b>Peter Arnett. Coverage of Persian Gulf War.</b>
  His coverage from Baghdad provided viewers with material from the
  other side of the war--a rare event in most combats. He kept
  information flowing despite facing censorship. (Christopher
  Harper)</p>
  <p>____1991 <b>Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele.
  <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> series: "America: What Went
  Wrong."</b> Grass roots economics. Paper prints 400,000 extra
  copies. (Mitchell Stephens)</p>
  <p>____1991 <b>Melissa Fay Greene. "Praying for Sheetrock."</b> A
  brilliantly executed look at racism and justice delayed, justice
  denied in the South with a beautifully rendered sense of place.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1991 <b>Nicholas Lemann. "The Promised Land."</b> Like
  "Common Ground," from which it probably drew considerable
  inspiration, Lemann�s book is a monumental study of a part of
  American life that few of even the most intrepid journalists
  choose to examine. It looks squarely and courageously at the
  lives of several desperately poor families in one of the nation�s
  most degraded communities. Lemann lived and worked with these
  people for many months, under conditions that few other reporters
  would consider enduring. And his findings, controversial though
  some of them are, give us the most vivid picture available to a
  non-scholarly audience of how the so-called underclass emerged
  and how they live. There is, of course, a more conventionally
  historical section of the book--the story of the emergence of the
  Great Society, but it is the re-creation of the lives of the
  inner-city poor that makes this such an important work. (Alan
  Brinkley)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Norman McLean. "Young Men and Fire."</b> Perhaps
  the greatest opening paragraph in all of modern non-fiction. And
  unforgettable, when the elderly McLean struggles up the steep
  sides of the Mann Gulch trying to imagine what was in the minds
  of the smokejumpers as they raced against the flames behind them
  50 years earlier. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Maria Henson. "To Have and to Harm, Kentucky�s
  Failure to Protect Women From the Men who Beat Them"
  editorials.</b> The <i>Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader</i>
  editorials led to an increased awareness of wife beating and to
  the passage of new laws that protected victims and opened files
  of domestic violence complaints, and other advances. (David
  Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Richard Ben Cramer. "What It Takes: The Road to
  the White House."</b> (Gene Roberts) A virtuoso account of seven
  candidates� attempts to win the presidency in 1988. Not your
  father�s Teddy White. (Ben Yagoda)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Joseph Mitchell. "Up at the Old Hotel."</b>
  (Collection of much older pieces.) Quirky, eccentric, and oddly
  joyous, this series of portraits of New York City at midcentury
  and its inhabitants celebrates the extraordinary in the lives of
  the ordinary people. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Mike Toner. "When Bugs Fight Back."</b> Articles
  on drug-resistant diseases and pesticide resistant insects for
  the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. The articles by Toner
  helped to create the awareness that pesticides and antibiotics
  have become less and less effective as insects and infections
  have built up resistance. William L. Roper, the director of the
  Centers for Disease Control, wrote "These articles are
  comprehensive, accurate and serve as an effective alert to a
  growing public-health problem." (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1992 <b>Bill Buford. "Among the Thugs."</b> A fascinating
  look at soccer hooliganism in the UK and, more broadly, the
  society of men and male violence. A great piece of intellectual
  journalism--Hunter Thompson meets Susan Sontag, if an analogy is
  required. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1993 <b>David Remnick. "Lenin�s Tomb."</b> (Gene
  Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1993 <b>Roy Guman. Reporting on Serbian concentration
  camps.</b> <i>Newsday</i>�s chief European correspondent was the
  first journalist to report in depth on the Serbian concentration
  camps in the former Yugoslavia. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1993 <b>Eileen Welsome. "America�s Atomic Victims" and
  "The Plutonium Experiment" series</b> for the <i>Albuquerque
  Tribune</i>. Reports on the secret U. S. experiments with
  plutonium that introduced to the public to what Energy Secretary
  Hazel O�Leary called the "darkest side" of the Cold War:
  government-sanctioned experiments with radioactive substances on
  U.S. citizens. Welsome�s work pushed the Department of Energy to
  release documents, and President Clinton convened a special
  meeting of federal agencies involved in radiation experiments.
  (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1993 <b>C. Carr. "On Edge."</b> A collection of her
  <i>VillageVoice</i> pieces on performance art (broadly
  conceived), sexually "deviant" and sacrilegious art, art that
  messes with the boundaries of race and other cultural categories,
  and the political controversies surrounding all this work. On one
  level, an extended meditation on that vexed question, what is
  art, and the emerging corollary question, what is criticism; on
  another, a powerful argument about what�s at stake in what she
  calls the "war on art." Best body of journalism extant on these
  subjects. A convincing answer to Arlene Croce�s claim that art of
  the Bill T Jones ilk is not amenable to criticism, written before
  Croce made it. (Ellen Wilis)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b>Rick Bragg. "The Serial Diner."</b> Appeared in
  the <i>New York Times</i>. (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b>Rick Bragg. Account for the <i>New York Times</i>
  of a tornado demolishing a rural church during Sunday
  services.</b> (Gene Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b>Steve James, Fred Marx and Peter Gilbert. "Hoop
  Dreams."</b> This documentary follows two aspiring
  basketball-playing inner-city youths from high school to college.
  Great insight into what helps and what prevents these young men
  from succeeding. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b>Tom Junod. "The Abortionist."</b> Possibly the
  best magazine piece I�ve read in at least a decade. Won <i>GQ</i>
  the National Magazine Award. Three of the principals in the piece
  were shot (two mortally) by anti-abortionists a month after the
  story came out. (Lamar Graham)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b>Mikal Gilmore. "Shot in the Heart."</b> Both as a
  companion piece to "The Executioner�s Song" and as a work on its
  own, this is a lyrical, brooding meditation on a hardscrabble,
  deeply American family which, if described as merely
  dysfunctional, would take it as a compliment. It goes a long way
  to explaining, though not excusing, the roots of criminality in a
  culture that seems to take delight in exacerbating antisocial
  tendancies. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1994 <b><i>The Akron Beacon Journal</i>. "A Question of
  Color"</b> series of extended reports on race relations. The
  newspaper devoted 29 reporters, photographers, artists, and
  editors for the better part of the year to a series of articles
  about race relations. The series examined many aspects of race
  relations within Akron and in the nation in general. A
  newspaper-sponsored effort, called "Coming Together," initiated
  dialogue between the races in the Akron area and has become a
  model for "public" journalism. (David Mindich)</p>
  <p>____1995 <b>Rick Bragg. "All She Has, $150,000, Is Going to a
  University."</b> Appeared in the <i>New York Times.</i> (Gene
  Roberts)</p>
  <p>____1995 <b>Jonathan Harr. "A Civil Action."</b> This is a
  compelling legal drama about a battle between bereaved parents
  and the corporations whose pollution may have killed their
  children. Few accounts have captured the drama and inner workings
  of the legal system as well. It is assigned reading in many law
  schools. (Stephen Solomon)</p>
  <p>____1996 <b>Frank McCourt. "Angela�s Ashes."</b> The
  immigrant�s experience in reverse, this work reinvents the uses
  and possibilities of voice. A kind of odd miracle occurs when
  reading this book: although almost none of the particulars of
  this man�s life apply to the reader, it feels in the end as if
  they all do. (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1996 <b>Leon Gast. "When We Were Kings."</b> Documentary
  on Mohammed Ali. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1996 <b>James Carroll. "An American Requiem: God, My
  Father and the War that Came Between Us."</b> Using his own
  biography as the son of a brigadier general and as a pacifist
  ex-priest, Carroll brings the war home, transcending the pitfalls
  of memoir and creating a universal story out of his experience.
  (Madeleine Blais)</p>
  <p>____1997 <b>Joseph Dorman. "Arguing the World."</b> New York
  intellectuals Irving Howe, Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell, Nathan
  Glazer. The only documentary I�ve ever seen that shows
  intellectual life as something interesting. (Todd Gitlin)</p>
  <p>____1997 <b>Alan Berliner. "Nobody�s Business."</b> A graceful
  study of family and memory mainly through a superb interview with
  Berliner�s father. Emmy 1998. Generations collide as Berliner
  drags his reluctant father kicking and screaming down memory lane
  to probe the swirl of conflicts and affections that bind every
  family. What emerges is a stunningly rich portrait that finds
  both humor and pathos in Berliner�s obsession with boundaries of
  personal and collective memory. (Marcia Rock)</p>
  <p>____1998 <b>David Halberstam. "The Children."</b> (Pamela
  Newkirk)</p>
