<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3" color="#004080">The Model-T 
  stage: the Internet in its immaturity.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Every new technology – 
  and this certainly includes every new communications technology -- goes through 
  a period when it is immature and unformed. The Model-T stage, we might call 
  it. This period can last a long time.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Writing, for example, was 
  invented in Sumeria and Eygpt more than five thousand years ago. But, for the 
  first five hundred years of its history, scribes did little more than record 
  business transactions and data on the flooding of the Nile. For the first five 
  hundred years of writing, in other words, no one thought to scribble down a 
  story. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The earliest newspapers 
  – four hundred years ago -- began as lists of items presented as they arrived 
  in the print shop: Someone's political prospects might be touted on page one; 
  that person's death reported on page five. The first editor that we know of 
  – the first person charged with placing news items in some coherent order – 
  did not appear until many years later. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There are countless other 
  examples of new forms of communications struggling to find their way. And one 
  thing all these &quot;new media&quot; have in common during this stumbling Model-T 
  stage is that hardly anyone is aware that this is the stage they are at. In 
  the first few centuries of printing, for example, no one announced that the 
  products of their presses were still primitive and imagined them eventually 
  being replaced by Tolstoy or The New Yorker. We usually see ourselves as standing 
  at – or, more commonly, past – the apogee of human artistic and intellectual 
  progress, not somewhere on the upward slope.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Model-T stage is, of 
  course, precisely where the Internet is currently at. (TV, I would argue, hasn’t 
  gotten much further.) Despite all the billions of dollars that are now being 
  gambled on the Internet’s future, it seems unlikely that we are any better at 
  envisioning that future than folks in Henry Ford’s time were at envisioning 
  interstates or malls or even cars that didn’t require cranking.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Clicking our way around 
  the Web can certainly be interesting. Undoubtedly driving a Model-T seemed pretty 
  cool at the time, too. However, it is quite likely that we have not yet seen 
  the developments that will do for the Internet what the story did for writing, 
  or what the editor did for the newspaper, or what the gear shift did for the 
  automobile. When it comes to the Internet, we are still dealing with, to continue 
  the analogy, a car with running boards and without side windows, and we are 
  still – users, analysts, investors – driving unpaved roads.</font></P>
