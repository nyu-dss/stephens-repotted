      late owner of this shop -- DJ Screw -- could be an example of a new culture

      smoothly into the culture to the north would be seriously mistaken. It's 
      not just the half-built shantytown poverty (a per-capita GDP less than a 
      sixth as large). It's the sudden absence of the supposed global language 
      everywhere this shamefully Spanish-deficient El Gringo looks, except the 
      front desk of one of the better hotels. It's the crowds parading on the 
      walking street in the middle of town, so close to the hollow downtowns of 
      Texas. It's the relaxed but proud posture of the men at the restaurants.
