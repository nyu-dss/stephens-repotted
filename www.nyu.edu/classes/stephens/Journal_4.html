    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1"><a name="train"></a>Well, 
      that's a relief! I ask</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+1">ed 
      one of the conductors</font></b></font><font size="+1">, through someone 
      who speaks English at the station, whether this train I've just boarded 
      is safe. <font color="#804000">The train</font> goes from Europe to Asia, 
      from <font color="#804000">Moscow</font> to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. I'll 
      be getting off a bit earlier -- in Samarkand. It will take a few days, and 
      from the looks of it, I'll be the only foreigner on board, the only English 
      speaker. The conductor's answer? The train is &quot;<font color="#804000">almost 
      safe</font>.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But, after the last-minute 
      okay of my Kazak transit visa, I was mad-rushing to get here. So It's <font color="#804000">a 
      comfort</font> to lay my backpack down in this &quot;lux&quot; compartment 
      on this worn-rug, dirty-windowed, Uzbek-staffed train. <font color="#804000">May 
      22.</font> It's a comfort to be sitting and watching out a window, once 
      again. It's kinda fun to be, once again, the only American around and, consequently, 
      to get invited to visit the chief conductor's house when I make it to Tashkent. 
      And it's exciting to be going where I want to go, once again, which is to 
      where I haven't been. Besides, I'm pretty sure that conductor was only warning 
      me to keep my door locked at night. No problem there, I'm thinking. I do, 
      however, deploy my recently purchased chain to at least slow down anyone 
      with a notion to pinch my precious stuff.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#804000">The 
      World Movie</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> begins 
      to play, once again, as I push aside the curtains on the train's windows. 
      It features, right now: spring-green, thick-grassed lands; little ponds, 
      some of them colored by moss; herds of shiny-white giraffe birches; lilacs 
      -- lavender and, a first for me, white -- blooming and (presumably) perfuming; 
      petite Christmas-colored villages; <i>babushkas</i> in black robes and white 
      kerchiefs, carrying wooden farm tools. Dark-gray clouds make the case for 
      the futility of human existence. It's lucky it's only a movie, or I'd be 
      getting wet. It's lucky it's only a movie or I'd be losing my optimism.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I can see (best 
      seat in the house) everything -- <font color="#804000">a constantly changing 
      everything</font>. For soundtrack, I have a speaker, crackly-loud, in my 
      compartment, pumping in Russified, violined versions of American pop. The 
      volume-control knob...broken. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I <font color="#804000">almost</font> 
      know where I'm going. I can almost communicate with the other people on 
      this train. I almost brought enough food and water. I'm &quot;almost safe.&quot; 
      But at this moment I'm entirely happy to be here. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This train may not 
      exactly be making <font color="#804000">tracks</font>, but it is using them 
      rapidly.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I'm thinking -- 
      looking around the train, now -- about those rectangular, reddish-plaid, 
      <font color="#804000">cheap, plastic suitcase bags</font> into which many 
      of these Uzbeks, like so many Russians, have stuffed their stuff. I'm thinking 
      that I saw the same bags in South America, in Africa, in the poorest corners 
      of Europe. Here, as with those plastic, between-the-toes sandals, is a nonwestern, 
      rarely discussed example of globalization. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I have friends in 
      Russia, but I know that <font color="#804000">Russians</font> who have not 
      become your friend can be rather <font color="#804000">unfriendly</font> 
      (in some circumstances; I'm not foolish enough to take this too far). A 
      lot of not-nice emanates from behind counters, behind desks. And on Russian 
      trains I often went without a &quot;hello&quot; (a word I'm actually capable 
      of understanding in Russian). There's a historical explanation for this: 
      czars, serfs, gulags, wars and more wars. It's a persuasive explanation: 
      They've really had good reason to guard their own loaf of bread. But one 
      problem with that explanation is that the folks in Central Asia haven't 
      evaded much of that horrible history, but, on this Uzbek train, I am assaulted 
      by -- mostly nonverbal -- friendliness: People coming in to sit beside me, 
      even though we can't do much more than smile at each other. Foods of all 
      sorts are offered and shared. Warmth is exuded. Invitations extended. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Guy I don't recognize 
      comes into my compartment, wearing a tie. Asks to look at my passport. Looks 
      at my Uzbek visa, looks at my Russian visa. Asks for something: Is it money? 
      Holds up his hand and says &quot;five&quot; in Russian. I say I don't understand 
      -- a Russian phrase that often comes in handy. Here it seems better than 
      handy: He seems, somehow, satisfied. Gets me the blanket I need. Gives me 
      his business card. Then I seem to be being offered another place to stay 
      in Tashkent. Later I learn he's just a fellow passenger. Point is I so often 
      have <font color="#804000">so little idea what is going on</font>. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Indeed, there seems 
      to be a kind of relaxed understanding of what's happening on this train 
      that others possess, but I don't -- where, for example, we're stopping (and 
      the further we get from Moscow the more frequent and lengthy the stops become), 
      what's being sold on or near the train, when we're entitled to communal 
      food, who is responsible for what where. I suspect this understanding is 
      connected in some way with <font color="#804000">language</font>. Is this 
      purified befuddlement contributing to my spiritual development? Such opportunities 
      being rather uncommon back home.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A whole two-bed 
      sleeping compartment to myself until 2:05 a.m., <font color="#804000">May 
      23</font>, when I awake to someone knocking on my door. &quot;Who's there?&quot; 
      ain't gonna do it here. Who'd understand? Instead, I watch all the security 
      procedures I'd worked out in my head (along with the chain, I'd even purchased 
      extra door-locking wire with this long and deep train ride in mind), I watch 
      them evaporate. I succumb to the basic human impulse toward amicability. 
      I simply open the door. The knocker, blessedly, proves to be one of the 
      friendly conductors. He points to<font color="#804000"> the other bed</font>. 
      He points to himself. I nod my head. We lock the door again. He goes to 
      sleep. (I suspect that the beds supposed to be reserved for the conductors 
      have been sold on the side.) At 7:55 a.m. they change shifts, and conductor 
      number two -- a man of greater girth -- stretches out across from me and 
      immediately falls asleep.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">When, a bit later, 
      I cautiously, trying to let that sleeping conductor lie, open the curtain 
      a bit and take a peek out the window, I see nothing but flat, <font color="#804000">grassy 
      steppe</font>. Cossack-horse-feeding steppe. Barbarian-horde-horse-feeding 
      steppe. This is the grass eaten by the magnificent war machines that overran 
      civilizations from China to Rome. It stretches too far on the too big continent 
      I am once again entering -- this time without turning back. It has caused 
      too much trouble.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Long, increasingly 
      slow, train. Starts cold and gets <font color="#804000">hot</font> and then 
      hotter. That gift of a blanket loses value. The fact that the window in 
      my compartment doesn't open grows more frustrating. Leave the door open 
      and everyone stares in; close it and whatever motion the train lends the 
      air my air must do without. I laze and read and write -- six new essays 
      before we arrive. I can take heat; I just crawl inside myself, putting some 
      distance between me and my skin. (Same trick apparently unavailable to me 
      when it's cold; I can't take cold.)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I visit the dining 
      car. Eat a meal. My name there is simply <font color="#804000">&quot;America&quot;</font> 
      -- &quot;here America,&quot; &quot;you're welcome America.&quot; The uneasy 
      rider. But this will be America's last visit to the dining car. When I head 
      that way this evening for a beer, the chief conductor catches me, directs 
      me back to my compartment and insists on providing a liter-and-a-half bottle 
      of beer for me himself. When I head that way another time in search of a 
      meal, he sends me back and has someone bring me a meal. On the way back 
      I shake a couple of hands. Hereabouts Mr. America is something of a celebrity, 
      or a conversation piece, or a mascot, or the butt of jokes. Hard to tell.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Got on the train 
      with that Kazak <font color="#804000">transit visa <font color="#000000">finally

      picking up distu</font></font>rbing hints -- hints that we're also passing 
      through another country. Uh oh. Goes by the name of Turkmenistan. Nothing 
      to do now but laze, read, write and occasionally try to communicate my problem 
      to some of my new friends. The chief conductor assures me that he'll take

      the world, with her hand). Turns out to speak more English than just about 
      any other adult I meet on this train. Turns out to be not enough English 
      to carry on a conversation (even with help from my pitiful shards of Russian) 
      that extends much beyond recitals of where-from, what-do and how many children 
      -- in her case: Samarkand (but of Russian ancestry), journalism student 
      (of all things) and, not surprisingly, none. Everybody I've met around the 
      world has heard of &quot;New York,&quot; which helps in my case. (New Jersey 
      is another matter.)</font></b></p>

      Apparently aren't a lot of people living in Russia with reason to spend 
      a few days traveling to Uzbekistan. (Many people of Russian origin have 
      been exiting these countries.) The females -- passengers and hawkers on 
      the platforms -- are wearing a wide variety of clothing from Western to

      him and his assistant in a room, one of two, in the adjoining house. The 
      cooking going on -- our dinner -- in the other room will significantly ease 
      the chill. </font></b></p>

      inside or out. Kids around. They don't go to school. (Nearest school would 
      be fifty kilometers away, I'm informed.) Oil lamp. Wood stove. Old photos. 
      Battery operated clock. Old portable typewriter -- though I don't think 
      anyone around can read or write. Three members of the family that lives 
      here (whose members earn money by putting up passing-through tourists) sleep 
      together in one bed in the kitchen, cause the three of us have occupied 
      the other room. Outside an animal pen and three outlying yurts. Around us 
      in this already high valley: still higher green mountains.</font></b></p>

      still-a-bit-tense border, is closed on Saturday. </font></b></p>

      (Perhaps this is because we're in mountain climbing/trekking country, where 
      Americans ain't that rare: fifty percent of his business, the driver says.) 
      I'm embarrassed to admit that I've gotten used, when paying (especially 
      a lot), to a certain amount of deference. There is little of that here in 
      the Volga. The driver does speak some English, but he and his friend mostly 
      have their conversation. They mostly listen to their music. (One English 
      tape is mixed into their collection of Russian tapes: Cher's greatest hits. 
      I'm liking it.) I have to ask for any guidance or explanations. Alone, you're 
      more sensitive to these things. Alone, you're more vulnerable to these things.

      While waiting, I sneak out the door of the car to videotape a particularly 
      cool-looking white-hatted horseman who passes by. Uh oh! Here comes a rifle-carrying 
      soldier. No photography at military sites! (This rule, of course, obtains 
      all over the world.) Foreigners must remain in their vehicles! He's taking 
      umbrage. I'm looking my most apologetic. My driver is talking fast. I'm 
      signing that I'm sorry and won't think of doing it again. Any delay this 
      time would be my fault. The soldier is eventually mollified. The great video 
      <i>artiste</i> chastened. We get through.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">And 
      the driver begins to go fast. We pass, with a trail of dust behind us, most 
      of those 4 by 4s. Nervous about the border, I cheer him on. The road, still 
      looking for a break in the mountains, turns to the left. Running alongside 
      us on the right is a wire barrier -- <font color="#804000">an electrified 
      fence</font>, built by the Soviets, presumably to contain the Chinese. It 
      presumably is no longer turned on.</font></b></p>

      and the top of the <font color="#804000">Torugart Pass</font>, 3574 meters, 
      which may very well be higher than I've ever been. My driver hands a couple 
      of packs of cigarettes to a border guard here. A couple of more to one there. 
      At other times it's newspapers (more my kind of bribe). I do my part by 
      asking a border guard and the leader of the group of a couple of dozen French 
      tourists who pour out of those 4 by 4s if I might go through ahead of them. 
      Okay. Just two more people to bribe: the guards in charge of searching our 
      luggage. A large bag of vegetables for one. Another large bag also full 
      of carrots and greens for the other. We go through without waiting for a 
      search. The guards used to ask for cash bribes, my driver explains (He's 
      getting a little more friendly). But some tour guides began to complain. 
      Cigarettes, newspapers and vegetables they can, apparently, get away with.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">I

      Snow is falling lightly. (This border is usually closed until May.) Goodbye 
      jury-rigged Volga. It did get me through. Hello to a securely capitalistic 
      VW Santana. I catch myself before saying hello to my new driver in Russian,

    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Chinese border stations 
      do require an excessive amount of passport showing and form filling. They 
      do not require bribes. A border guard asks me to allow a border something-or-other 
      to ride in our car. I respond with the universal &quot;no problem.&quot; 
      He then says, <font color="#804000">&quot;Welcome to China, friend.&quot;</font> 
      I like the sound of that. Wish I'd had more such welcomes on this trip.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Welcome to China. 
      Not only a very populous country, a rather large country, I'm learning. 
      The mountains are, not surprisingly, just as high going down here on the 
      Chinese side. But they do not, surprisingly, shelter verdant (That is the 
      word you're supposed to use here, isn't it?) pastures. On this side, the 
      south side, of the pass, the mountains are <font color="#804000">red and 
      brown and gray and dry</font>. A few yaks chew on what little green is to 
      be found.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> I'm <font color="#804000">arguing 
      with the Paris anti-globalization guys</font> in my head as we follow a 
      more dry than wet river bed through these striped canyons. Seeing some small 
      Chinese villages along the way, filled with kids in jogging-suit-like school 
      uniforms. Thinking about <font color="#804000">the American suburbs</font>. 
      Is it possible that what seems so ugly about the American suburbs is in 
      part their <i>diversity</i>? One house, one store in a strip mall, often 
      seems to belong to a different movie than does its neighbor -- while old 
      villages display that pleasing homogeneity. Le Traditional Village Uniforme.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And aren't there 
      (I'm following Harvard Prof. Michael Blake here) </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#804000">two 
      types of diversity</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">: 
      Diversity among cultures and diversity within cultures. Type one only benefits 
      those of us fortunate enough to wander among cultures, and there can't be 
      too many of us or we might spread ideas and weaken distinctions. Type two 
      benefits everyone. Don't modern cities and suburbs contain much more type-two 
      diversity than traditional cultures? The only question is whether this diversity 
      within cultures -- different ideas, different architectural styles, trying 
      to coexist on the same block -- will eventually fade, benefiting no one, 
      whether we'll be left with a vast, gray suburb. This particular nightmare 
      scenario seems based on the assumption that without long-lived, high-walled 
      &quot;traditional&quot; cultures diversity production will cease. That strikes 
      me as an unlikely scenario. And given the potential benefits, isn't it worth 
      chancing?</font></b></p>
