<P>____1902-1903 <B>Alexander Posey. Series of letters from &quot;Fus Fixico&quot;</B> 
  that appeared in the <I>Indian Journal</I> of the old Indian Territory. Fabulous 
  satire of current events. Called for the end of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
  (Mark N. Trahant)</P>
<P>____1902-1904 (series first published in <I>McClure’s</I> magazine, book published 
  in 1904) <B>Lincoln Steffens. &quot;Shame of the Cities.&quot;</B> Enough said. 
  (Todd Gitlin) The origins of today’s muckracking, and the shaming effects of 
  investigative reporting, are found here. (Jay Rosen) Sets the forms and aims 
  of modern urban reporting and investigative reporting for two generations. A 
  muckraking classic. (Anne Matthews) Classic--the classic--muckraking. Crucial 
  in calling attention to municipal corruption. Led to reforms in some cities. 
  Not enough, argued Steffens. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1902-1904 (book 1904) <B>Ida Tarbell. &quot;History of Standard Oil&quot; 
  investigation.</B> Also in <I>McClure’s</I> magazine. Documented ruthless monopolistic 
  practices. Contributed to successful effort to break up Rockefeller oil monopoly. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1903 <B>W.E.B. DuBois. &quot;The Souls of Black Folk.&quot;</B> The precursor 
  to Baldwin and even to &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X.&quot; Seems to 
  me part of an on-going colloquy about the very nature of racism and its evil 
  manifestations. Heartachingly measured, but has an integrity and on-going freshness 
  that makes it as important today as when it was published. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1914 <B>Walter Lippmann. Early essays for the <I>New Republic</I>.</B> 
  Extraordinarily symmetric prose and an extraordinarily clear mind (Leaner in 
  his youth?): &quot;Every sane person knows that it is a greater thing to build 
  a city than to bombard it, to plough a field than to trample it, to serve mankind 
  than to conquer it. And yet once the armies get loose, the terrific noise and 
  shock of war make all that was valuable seem pale and dull and sentimental.&quot; 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1914 <B>Richard Harding Davis. Coverage of German march into Belgium.</B> 
  Several versions of this account appeared in daily newspapers, magazines, books, 
  etc. The Collier’s version is wonderful. All are vivid and put the reader on 
  the scene. &quot;Like a river of steel, it flowed,&quot; Davis said of the army. 
  (Gene Roberts) An aging reporter who’d cheapened his craft for a decade with 
  thumbsucking pieces and parlor-car-window dispatches has a last flash of brilliance: 
  in the right place at the right time, he conveys the texture of a strange new 
  concept--world war--through pure description: journalism as the first rough 
  draft of history, indeed. (Anne Matthews) A bit of derring-do (after an attempt 
  to get through German lines Davis was arrested as a spy) from the archetype 
  of the romantic war correspondent and one of our best reporters and writers. 
  &quot;The entrance of the German army into Brussels has lost the human quality. 
  . . . What came . . . is not men marching, but a force of nature like a tidal 
  wave, and avalanche or a river flooding its banks. At this minute it is rolling 
  through Brussels as the swollen waters of the Conemaugh Valley swept through 
  Johnstown.&quot; (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1914 <B>Max Eastman. Editorials in <I>The Masses</I> regarding the 1913 
  Ludlow Massacre.</B> Smart, clear, crisp and (gasp) modern. (Michael Hirsch)</P>
<P>____1916-1922 <B>Carlos Montezuma. <I>Wassaja</I>.</B> Montezuma’s newspaper 
  said that missionaries and anthropologists--and friends of the Indian--were 
  messing up things. He used Socratic dialogue and signed the pieces &quot;Julius,&quot; 
  said to be a Bureau of Indian Affairs-governed, but not BIA-educated, Indian. 
  (Mark N. Trahant)</P>
<P>____1919 <B>John Reed. &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World.&quot;</B> If as 
  Matthew Arnold said &quot;journalism is literature in a hurry,&quot; this is 
  a perfect example. (Madeleine Blais) Historians would do better. But this was 
  probably the most consequential news story of the century, and Reed was there, 
  and Reed could write. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1919 <B>Hugh Fullerton. Black Sox scandal.</B> Fullerton, a respected baseball 
  writer, broke it--probably the top sports story of the century in this country. 
  Much criticized for his early investigations – how dare he make such charges? 
  But he was right, and his facts would be used in baseball’s own investigations. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1920 <B>Richard Grozier. Investigation of the original Ponzi scheme.</B> 
  Grozier led the <I>Boston Post</I>’s crusade to uncover one of the largest swindles 
  in American history, that of Charles Ponzi, who was one of Boston’s leading 
  figures. <I>The Post</I>’s coverage helped to bring down Ponzi, whose name has 
  joined the English lexicon. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1921 <B>Herbert Bayard Swope. &quot;Klan Exposed.&quot;</B> Swope and a 
  battlion of <I>New York World</I> reporters exposed the secret and illegal workings 
  of the Klan. Response by the Klan: hate letters and a &quot;DEATH ULTIMATUM&quot; 
  sent to the <I>World</I>. But the <I>World</I> won a Pulitzer. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1922 <B>Ben Hecht. Series of columns: &quot;1,001 Afternoons in Chicago.&quot;</B> 
  A masterful writer using a basic journalistic form--the column--to explore philosophical 
  limitations and social blind spots of journalism. His method: self-criticism, 
  off-path wanderings, off-beat wonderings. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1922. <B>William Allen White. &quot;To an Anxious Friend.&quot;</B> Famous 
  defense of free speech, especially in times of danger. Appeared in the <I>Emporia 
  (Kansas) Gazette</I> and was widely reprinted throughout the U.S. (David Mindich) 
  Work of the best known and most respected of the small-town editors. True moral 
  voices &quot;from the heartland&quot; have been few and far between; this guy 
  pulled it off. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1923 <B>Samuel D. McCoy. &quot;Crusade to End Florida Peonage Evil.&quot;</B> 
  <I>New York World </I>reporting on the case of young man who was beaten to death 
  by a &quot;whipping boss&quot; in a Florida jail. The investigation led to the 
  arrest of the killer and Florida’s suspension of whipping in prisons. (David 
  Mindich)</P>
<P>____1924 <B>Grantland Rice. Notre Dame’s &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; </B>Perhaps 
  the most famous lead of all time: &quot;Outlined against a blue-gray October 
  sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as Famine, 
  Pestilence, Destruction and Death. But these are only aliases. Their real names 
  are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden. They formed the crest of the South 
  Bend Cyclone before which another Army football team was swept over the precipice 
  at the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down on 
  the bewildering panorama spread on the green plain below.&quot; (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1925 <B>H.L. Mencken. Coverage of the Scopes monkey trial.</B> Eviscerated 
  William Jennings Bryant and all who admired him. Devastating and effective. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1925<B> H.L Mencken. &quot;In Memoriam: W.J.B.&quot;</B> One of the preeminent 
  examples of Mencken’s acerbic criticism. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1926 <B>Julian LaRose Harris’s <I>Columbus Enquirer-Sun</i></B> (smallest 
  daily in Georgia). Crusading editorials against Ku Klux Klan, local lynching 
  and laws against teaching evolution in public schools. Editorials lose subscribers, 
  win Pulitzer. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1926 <B>Damon Runyon. Crime reporting.</B> The style found in much American 
  detective fiction can be traced back to here. Guys and dolls. Blondes and rubes. 
  No style is more street-wise; few have been as intense. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1928 <B>Walter Lippmann. <I>New York World</I> editorial dealing with the 
  case of the &quot;Radium Girls.&quot;</B> The editorial and an accompanying 
  cartoon of the five women before the barred doors of justice brought the courts 
  around and helped the &quot;Radium Girls&quot; in their case. They also exemplified 
  Lippmann’s ideal of the role of the press in social conflict and the difficulties 
  the press had in dealing with scientific issues. (William Kovarik)</P>
<P>____1930 <B>H.L Mencken. &quot;Christian Science Technique.&quot;</B> One of 
  the preeminent examples of Mencken’s acerbic criticism. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1931-34 <B>Dorothy Thompson. Reports on the rise of Hitler</B> in <I>Cosmopolitan</I> 
  and Harper’s. Early. Prescient. Powerful. She travels – checks in, checks out 
  – through a country she portrays as already haunted by onrushing villainy and 
  horror: &quot;I Saw Hitler.&quot; (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1935 <B>Heywood Broun. &quot;It Seems to Me: 1925-1935.&quot;</B> Collected 
  columns. A passion for the underdog. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1936 <B>John Steinbeck. Reports on Okie migrant camp life</B> for the <I>San 
  Francisco News</I>. Draws wide attention to plight of these farm workers. The 
  basis for &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1936 <B><I>St-Louis Post-Dispatch</I>. Crusade against voter fraud</B> 
  that invalidated 40,000 fraudulent ballots. The colorful coverage included photos 
  of abandoned buildings with captions such as &quot;56 registered from here.&quot; 
  The governor fired the entire election board following the newspaper’s exposures. 
  (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1936<B> Robert Capa. Spanish Civil War photos</B> for Life. Who can forget 
  Capa’s capturing of the instant of death in a Republican solider. The preeminent 
  image of the Spanish Civil War. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1937<B> Herb Morrison. Tearful live report on explosion of the Hindenburg</B> 
  for WLS in Chicago. Is there any more famous line than &quot;Oh, the humanity&quot; 
  in the history of journalism? (Lamar Graham) Hardly objective, but what immediacy 
  and emotion! &quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! . . . It’s burst into flames. . . .Get out of 
  the way, please. Oh my, this is terrible. . . . It is burning, bursting into 
  flames and is falling. . . .&quot; (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1937-38<B> Ernest Hemingway. Journalistic reports on the Spanish Civil 
  War.</B> Yes, he cared about trout fishing and bull fighting but this was war-- 
  with the fascists! Particularly powerful piece: &quot;A New Kind of War.&quot; 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1938 <B>Bob Considine. Louis-Schmeling fight column.</B> (Paul K. Harral)</P>
<P>____1939-45 <B>Mollie Painter-Downes. <I>New Yorker</I> dispatches from WWII 
  London.</B> Probably second only to Murrow in informing the American public 
  about life in London during the Blitz. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1940 <B>Edward R. Murrow. &quot;This is London . . .&quot;</B> radio reports 
  for CBS on the German bombing of London. Also collected in book form. (David 
  Brinkley, Jay Rosen) Still gives people chills. (Lamar Graham) Superb eye for 
  sympathetic detail. Controlled, understated portraits of courage of Londoners 
  rallies support for Allies in U.S. (Mitchell Stephens) </P>
<P>____1940-45 <B>Ernie Pyle. Reports from Europe and the Pacific during World 
  War II.</B> His name is synonymous with WWII journalism. (Lamar Graham) The 
  GI’s perspective. Detailed. Human. Moving. Widely popular. Few made better use 
  of notepad or typewriter. (Mitchell Stephens) Especially &quot;The Death of 
  Captain Waskow.&quot; At the front lines in Italy, Jan. 10, 1944. It’s vivid, 
  moving and puts you there. (Gene Roberts) Especially his writing about D-Day. 
  (Jay Rosen)</P>
<P>____1940-50 <B>George Seldes. <I>In Fact</I>.</B> His own weekly newsletter 
  exposes &quot;falsehoods in the daily press&quot;--including their reluctance, 
  because of advertisers, to report on link between cigarettes and cancer. (Mitchell 
  Stephens)</P>
<P>____1941 <B>William Shirer. &quot;Berlin Diary.&quot;</B> There is absolutely 
  no better book by an American about the rise of the Third Reich. A gripping--and 
  harrowing--view from inside Hitler’s Germany. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1941 <B>Rebecca Wells. &quot;Black Lamb and Gray Falcon.&quot;</B> Fifty-odd 
  years after it was written, it remains the best primer on the Balkans. (Lamar 
  Graham)</P>
<P>____1941 <B>James Agee and Walker Evans. &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.&quot;</B> 
  Incomparable poetic evocation in the guise of cataloguing, essays, photos and 
  pastiche. Nobody can ever do that again--it’s too innocent. (Todd Gitlin) For 
  its prose and for visiting the forgotten Americans. (Jay Rosen) The classic 
  go-see magazine assignment, rejected by the head office, that liberated journalists 
  from the cult of objectivity. The only catch: you have to be Agee to pull it 
  off. Opens the way for Mailer and Didion to experiment with form and structure. 
  (Anne Matthews) Just the photos by Walker Evans. Forgive me, but Agee’s writing 
  in this volume is so over the top as to be alienating, so despite the usual 
  knee-jerk worship of this volume, I say the photos are its true heart and what 
  beautiful, American, narrative-packed unforgettable faces we get here. (Madeleine 
  Blais) </P>
<P>____1941 <B>H.L. Mencken. &quot;Newspaper Days.&quot;</B> America’s greatest 
  newspaperman in a rare genial mood: an industry memoir crossed with a terrific 
  series of How I Got That Story tales. (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1943 <B>Joseph Mitchell. &quot;McSorley’s Wonderful Saloon.&quot;</B> Articles 
  and profiles for the <I>New Yorker</I>. Big shots, circus freaks, cranks--Mitchell 
  profiled them all with dignity and compassion. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1943 <B>Joseph Mitchell. &quot;The Mohawks in High Steel.&quot;</B> Has 
  had an enduring shelf life, perhaps because a fierce literary sensibility was 
  visited on the real world. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1944 <B>Robert Capa. Ten photographs from D-Day.</B> Capa went in with 
  the second wave at Omaha Beach. His pictures--only ten survived an over-eager 
  processor back in London--were perhaps the only record of one of the modern 
  world’s most important moments. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>____1944 <B>Bill Mauldin. Cartoons for <I>Stars and Stripes</I>.</B> Critique 
  of army brass outrages Gen. Patton, delights &quot;dogface&quot; GIs. (Mitchell 
  Stephens) </P>
<P>____1944 <B>A.J. Liebling. &quot;The Road Back to Paris,&quot;</B> Contains 
  Liebling’s World War II reportage, which was revolutionary in bringing literary 
  style, humor and humanity to war coverage. (Ben Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1945 <B>Homer Bigart. Account in the <I>New York Herald-Tribune</I> of 
  being over Japan in a bomber when World War II came to an end.</B> Lede grabs 
  you. Story puts you there. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1945 <B>Walter Bernstein. &quot;Keep Your Head Down.&quot;</B> Writings 
  about World War II. (Mitchell Stephens) </P>
<P>____1945<B> Margaret Bourke-White. Photographs for <I>Life</I> magazine following 
  the defeat of Germany.</B> She captures Nazi suicides and prisoners at Buchenwald. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1945 <B>James Agee. Piece on the bombing of Hiroshima.</B> &quot;The greatest 
  and most terrible of wars ended this week. . . .&quot; A platform for one of 
  <I>Time</I>’s best-known writers to produce one of journalism’s most eloquent 
  pieces. (Barrett Seaman)</P>
<P>____1945 <B>Hodding Carter, Jr. &quot;Go for Broke.&quot;</B> One of a series 
  of anti-racism editorials that appeared in Carter’s <I>Delta Democrat-Times</I> 
  (Greenville, MS) and won a Pulitzer. (Jay Rosen)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>____1945 <B>Joe Rosenthal. Photograph of Marines raising a U.S. flag</B> on 
  Mount Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima. Iconic. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1945 <B>Edward R. Murrow. Report of the liberation of Buchenwald.</B> This 
  report is one, if not the best, example of radio reporting at its finest. Murrow 
  uses superb description of what happened there. (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1945-48 <B>Sam Lacey. Coverage of Jackie Robinson</B> as he broke baseball’s 
  color barrier. (Eric Newton)</P>
<P>____1946 <B>John Hersey. &quot;Hiroshima.&quot;</B> (Richard Petrow, Ben Yagoda) 
  In its very quietude and the deliberate small scale of its scope, this work 
  nevertheless achieves volume and magnitude. Poetic, prescient, and respectful 
  of the clash of culture and the clash of wills that ushered in the atomic era. 
  (Madeleine Blais) The pinnacle of war reporting, the first polished example 
  of the nonfiction novel, the beginning of the New Yorker’s power to shape the 
  socio-political agenda (Anne Matthews) Originally given an entire issue of The 
  New Yorker. Nothing played as large a role in awakening Americans to the horrors 
  of nuclear weapons as this close-up on the survivors. And the writing has a 
  remarkable, at times poetic clarity. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1946 <B>George Orwell. &quot;Politics and the English Language.&quot;</B> 
  True then, true now. A warning for the journalist who gets too close to any 
  agenda (however appealing) or any inner circle (ditto). (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1947<B> A. J. Liebling. &quot;Wayward Pressman.&quot;</B> Collection of 
  press criticism for <I>The New Yorker.</I> He did it first and probably best. 
  Consistently witty, occasionally lyrical. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1947 <B><I>The New Yorker</I>. &quot;<I>The New Yorker</I> Book of War 
  Pieces.&quot;</B> It wasn’t only A.J. Liebling (see above). John Lardner, John 
  Hersey, Walter Bernstein, Daniel Lang, Edmund Wilson, E.J. Kahn and Philip Hamburger 
  all contributed to <I>The New Yorker</I>’s coverage of the war, which did more 
  than anything else to establish it as a serious journalistic magazine. (Ben 
  Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1949 <B>E. B. White. &quot;Here is New York.&quot;</B> E. B. White’s beautiful 
  ode to New York. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1949 <B>John Gunther. &quot;Death Be Not Proud: A Memoir.&quot; </B>What 
  it is to be young, doomed and brave. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1949 <B>Meyer Berger. Report on killings of Howard Unruh.</B> This is the 
  story--4,000 words written on deadline--that finally wins this legendary <I>New 
  York Times</I> feature writer and columnist his Pulitzer. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1949 <B>Aldo Leopold. &quot;A Sand County Almanac.&quot;</B> Reports from 
  the field, literally: a scientist and professor turns out, for obscure wildlife 
  magazines, deceptively low-key pieces that--posthumously collected and edited--define 
  modern environmental writing, environmental history, environmental ethics. (Anne 
  Matthews)</P>
<P>____1949-54 <B>Harrison Salisbury. Reporting from the Soviet Union</B> for 
  the <I>New York Times</I>. (Richard Petrow)</P>
<P>____1950 <B>Herblock. Political cartoons.</B> Herbert Block coins term &quot;McCarthyism.&quot; 
  Hounds Nixon. Wins three Pulitzers. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1951 <B>Alfred Kazin. &quot;A Walker in the City.&quot;</B> An academic 
  turns to cultural reporting, and encapsulates the New York immigrant experience 
  better than anyone since Jacob Riis. (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1952 <B>Lillian Ross. &quot;Picture.&quot;</B> This book is why Capote’s 
  &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is <I>arguably </I>the first example of literary journalism. 
  (Lamar Graham) This account of the making of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; 
  published sixteen years before &quot;In Cold Blood,&quot; was truly the first 
  non-fiction novel. (Ben Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1953-71 <B>I.F. Stone. <I>I.F. Stone’s Weekly.</i></B> One man. Four pages. 
  Substantial if often delayed impact. He read the transcripts, uncovered the 
  contradictions and absurdities. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1954 <B>Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly. See It Now documentary taking 
  on Senator Joseph McCarthy.</B> (Michael Ludlum) Largely responsible for turning 
  the nation against that Red-baiter. (Lamar Graham) Rare (unprecedented?) courage 
  by network journalists. After Army-McCarthy hearings, probably the major blow 
  the Senator took. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1954 <B>Anthony Lewis. Clearing of Abraham Chasanow.</B> Lewis received 
  a Pulitzer for articles in the Washington, D.C., <I>Daily News</I> clearing 
  Chasanow, a Navy employee, of being a security risk. The Navy later officially 
  called its own actions a &quot;grave injustice.&quot; (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1954 <B>E.B. White. &quot;The Second Tree From the Corner.&quot;</B> Fugitive 
  pieces from a writer whose star has fallen considerably in the last quarter-century, 
  but whose voice was the one to beat in magazine writing from Harding’s time 
  to Kennedy’s. (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1955 <B>Murray Kempton. &quot;Part of Our Times: Some Ruins and Monuments 
  of the Thirties.&quot;</B> (George Will)</P>
<P>____1956<B> A.J. Liebling. &quot;The Sweet Science.&quot;</B> Journalism’s 
  perpetual nostalgie de la boue/de la banlieue conflicts made into literature 
  thanks to Liebling’s immaculate prose. Sports writing at its peak. (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1957 <B>Tom and Pat Gish. The weekly <I>Mountain Eagle</i></B>, Whitesburg, 
  Kentucky. Attacks on strip mining. Paper’s motto: &quot;It Screams!&quot; Boycotts 
  launched against it. Offices set on fire. Motto changed to: &quot;It Still Screams!&quot; 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1957 <B>Vance Packard. &quot;The Hidden Persuaders.&quot;</B> An investigation 
  of advertising and consumerism. His examination of the post-war explosion of 
  the consumer ethic in America and its exploitation by Madison Avenue. Of particular 
  interest was his discussion of subliminal advertising which, it’s safe to say, 
  most Americans were unaware of at the time. (Michael Ludlum)</P>
<P>____1958 <B>Ralph McGill. &quot;One Church, One School.&quot;</B> (Jay Rosen) 
  McGill’s editorial in the Atlanta Constitution was a forceful statement against 
  southern violence during the Civil Rights movement. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1959 <B>Martha Gellhorn. &quot;The Face of War.&quot;</B> Gellhorn, who 
  died in 1998, covered wars from the 1930s (the Spanish Civil War) to the 1980s 
  (the invasion of Panama), and her work stands up better than that of the man 
  she was briefly married to, Ernest Hemingway. (Ben Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1959 <B>James Baldwin. &quot;Letter from the South: Nobody Knows My Name.&quot;</B> 
  In the <I>Partisan Review</I>. Charged, crucial subject. Hot, humid prose. He 
  was there early, and he was there in force. Few works of journalism grab so 
  hard. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1960<B> Robert Drew, Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker. &quot;Primary.&quot;</B> 
  Early cinema verite documentary on Kennedy’s primary run. Camera follows Kennedy 
  around in cars and receptions. Groundbreaking style and coverage of a campaign. 
  (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1960 <B>Joseph Mitchell. &quot;The Bottom of the Harbor.&quot;</B> Another 
  lovely writer whose prose has become totemic for ambitious journalists: the 
  long opening paragraph of ‘The Rivermen’ (&quot;I often feel drawn to the Hudson 
  River, and I have spent a lot of time through the years poking around the part 
  of it that flows past the city. I never get tired of looking at it; it hypnotizes 
  me. I like to look at it in midsummer, when it is warm and dirty and drowsy, 
  and I like to look at it in January, when it is carrying ice...&quot;) bedevils 
  just about any reporter who cares about style. Mitchell is what every journalist 
  wants to be, and also what every journalist ought to fear becoming: a wonderful 
  writer who first deliberately erases the fact-fiction border . . . then falls 
  silent for decades. (Anne Matthews)</P>
<P>____1960 <B>Edward R. Murrow, David Lowe and Fred Friendly. CBS Reports documentary 
  &quot;Harvest of Shame.&quot;</B> (Michael Ludlum, Jay Rosen) The moment when 
  TV documentary and film production came together. Perfect writing to picture. 
  Story of migrant workers. (Marcia Rock) Expose of the condition of migrant farm 
  workers in the United States. Writing that you don’t get anymore. Shots that 
  they don’t hold anymore. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1961 <B>Theodore White’s &quot;The Making of the President 1960.&quot;</B> 
  This groundbreaking book told the story of the presidential election in a way 
  that had never been done before, and it has served as the model for presidential 
  journalism ever since. It treated the election as a long quest by individuals, 
  complete with discussions of personal character, &quot;inside baseball&quot; 
  discussions of political machines and candidate strategy, and a novelistic attention 
  to detail. It is <I>sui generis;</I> the Pulitzer Prize committee created a 
  special category in order to honor it. (Jon Enriquez) A revelation, at the time. 
  Took the public one large step closer to politicians. Not his fault if we haven’t 
  always liked what we have seen there since. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1961 <B>A.J. Liebling. &quot;The Earl of Louisiana.&quot;</B> Classic portrayal 
  of Earl Long. (Gene Roberts) A political primer written with great style that 
  is the harbinger of all great reporting about men in power and the twin lures 
  of corruption and abuse. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1962 <B>Rachel Carson. &quot;Silent Spring.&quot;</B> (David Brinkley, 
  Richard Petrow, Ben Yagoda) Felicitously brought together and popularized ideas 
  that were in the air, and sparked one of the major social movements of our era. 
  (Ellen Willis) It represents an exhaustive research effort, compelling reporting 
  of the findings, and a pivotal moment in communication with the general public 
  on a matter of policy. I cannot imagine a more appropriate example of the function 
  of a work of journalism. (Priscilla Coit Murphy) A rather large political movement 
  was spawned by this work. (Mitchell Stephens) Carson’s book, an expose of the 
  environmental consequences of DDT, is a classic of environmental reporting and 
  provided a vital impetus to the founding of the environmental activist movement.

<P>____1962-75<B> Peter Arnett. AP dispatches from Vietnam. </B>I don’t think 
  anyone captured the soldier’s-eye view of Vietnam better. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Murray Kempton. &quot;America Comes of Middle Age: Columns 1950-1962.&quot;</B> 
  (Richard Petrow, George Will)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Hazel Brannon Smith. &quot;Through Hazel’s Eyes.&quot;</B> Smith 
  became the first female winner of the Pulitzer prize because of her &quot;steadfast 
  adherence to her editorial duty in the face of great pressure and opposition.&quot; 
  In her editorials for the <I>Lexington (Miss.) Advertiser,</I> she tirelessly 
  criticized extremists and southern lawmakers. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather. Live coverage of the JFK assassination.</B> 
  I was born after JFK’s murder, but I remain haunted by the footage of Cronkite 
  and Rather bringing the news to the nation. I’ve never seen more emotional reporting. 
  (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Terry Southern. &quot;Twirling at Ole Miss.&quot;</B> Classic ‘60s 
  &quot;underground&quot; journalism. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>John Hershey. &quot;Here To Stay.&quot;</B> An anthology of his 
  <I>New Yorker</I> pieces, built around the theme of man’s determination to survive, 
  even at times and places (concentration camps in World War II, for example) 
  when life was at its worst. The collection includes &quot;Hiroshima&quot; and 
  much else that is stunning. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Robert Drew. &quot;Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment.&quot;</B> 
  Behind-the-scenes documentary aired on CBS shows President John F. Kennedy and 
  staff as they out-manuver Governor George Wallace and desegregate the University 
  of Alabama. (Mary Sisson)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>James Baldwin. &quot;The Fire Next Time.&quot;</B> An anguished 
  call to arms by one black writer battling the horrors of racism in America. 
  (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1963 <B>Betty Friedan. &quot;The Feminine Mystique.&quot;</B> Felicitously 
  brought together and popularized ideas that were in the air, and sparked one 
  of the major social movements of our era. (Ellen Willis) </P>
<P>____1963-72 <B>Gene Miller. Reporting that lead to the acquittal of two men 
  on death row.</B> In 1963, two white gas station attendants were shot to death 
  in Port St. Joe, Florida. Two black men, Freddie Pitts and Wilbert Lee, were 
  beaten and forced to confess to the crime. Four years later, another man confessed, 
  and a Miami Herald reporter, Gene Miller, spent eight and a half years investigating 
  and then trying to free the two men. Finally, with the case before the U.S. 
  Supreme Court, the men were pardoned by Florida’s governor. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1964 <B>Susan Sontag. &quot;Notes on Camp.&quot;</B> Its unusual form accomplished 
  what the author wanted: it succeeded in the difficult task of pinning down a 
  sensibility, so much so that our view of the phenomena collectively known as 
  camp will be forever filtered through this essay. (Madeleine Blais) Groundbreaking 
  intellectual journalism. (Lamar Graham) </P>
<P>____1964 <B>Lillian Ross. &quot;Reporting.&quot; </B><I>The New Yorker</I> 
  profile reaches an apotheosis in the marvelous collection that demonstrates 
  once and for all that great journalsim is in the details, whether describing 
  a beauty pageant, a high school class trip, the making of a movie, or a great 
  wirter (Hemingway) with a tendency to preen and pontificate. The Hemingway piece 
  alone could stand as a single nominee. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1964-77 <B>Eric Sevareid. Commentary and analysis pieces</B> aired on the 
  CBS Evening News with Walker Cronkite. (Michael Ludlum)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Morley Safer. Report for CBS on atrocities committed by American 
  soldiers on the hamlet of Cam Ne in Vietnam.</B> CBS officials didn’t want to 
  air this story. But Safer had film. President Lyndon Johnson wakes CBS’s president 
  to protest. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>John McPhee. &quot;A Sense of Where You Are.&quot;</B> The book 
  written from his <I>New Yorker</I> piece on Bill Bradley. (Gene Roberts) McPhee’s 
  profile of Bill Bradley, the Princeton basketball player, was his first major 
  story for The New Yorker and represents well his gift for detail, observation, 
  and phrasing. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Truman Capote. &quot;In Cold Blood.&quot;</B> A meticulous work 
  of sociology, psychology, legal studies, and literature. The standard bearer 
  for a certain kind of true crime journalism. Probably my top candidates for 
  a time capsule to be opened at the end of the next millenium. (Madeleine Blais) 
  No one had ever engaged in a process of journalistic reconstruction on this 
  scale before Capote. That he played fast and loose with the facts in some passages 
  was the fault of the author, not his method. (Ben Yagoda) An absolute classic--and 
  one of the first great examples of so-called literary journalism (Capote would 
  say<I> the</I> first example). (Lamar Graham) Capote’s chilling and detailed 
  account of the murder of a Kansas family and the lives of their killers. Genre 
  establishing. (Mitchell Stephens) A tour de force of crime writing, In Cold 
  Blood became a pioneer of literary journalism. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1965<B> Joseph Mitchell. &quot;Joe Gould’s Secret.&quot;</B> Mitchell was 
  the dean of literary journalism, and this incredibly subtle portrait of a Greenwich 
  Village charlatan was his masterpiece. (Ben Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Malcolm X and Alex Haley. &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X.&quot;</B> 
  Seems to me part of an on-going colloquy about the very nature of racism and 
  its evil manifestations. Goes nuclear, but has an integrity and on-going freshness 
  that makes it as important today as when it was published. (Madeleine Blais) 
</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Tom Wolfe. &quot;The Kandy-Kolored, Tangerine-Flake Streamline 
  Baby.&quot;</B> Wolfe is a great New Journalist but also the most important 
  and influential cultural reporter/polemicist to come out of the 60s. In the 
  pieces that make up the book, he not only chronicles in miraculous detail the 
  emergence of new cultural forms from the &quot;vinyl deeps&quot;; he invents 
  a style and rhetoric that owes as much to advertising as to literature and conveys 
  through its energy and exuberance the spirit of those new forms and of American 
  mass culture in general; and he effectively champions that culture against the 
  near-universal contempt of the intellectual establishment of the day. (Ellen 
  Willis) The</P>
<P>first and best collection by a writer who is, in my mind, our greatest living 
  critic of status, manners and mores. Others will object, but I think he’s modern 
  America’s Balzac. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Tom Wolfe. &quot;The Last American Hero.&quot;</B> The saga of 
  Junior Johnson, the stock car racing driver. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>Lennart Nilsson. Photo spread showing six-week-old human embryo.</B> 
  In <I>Life. </I>Look at the previously unseen. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1965 <B>George Plimpton. &quot;Paper Lion.&quot;</B> (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1966 <B>Ralph Nader. &quot;Unsafe at any Speed.&quot;</B> Nader’s expose 
  of the built-in safety deficiencies of the General Motors Corvair rang the starting 
  bell for a major consumer movement in the United States. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1966 <B>Gay Talese. &quot;Frank Sinatra Has a Cold.&quot;</B> Like a shimmering 
  short story, this compact, resonant piece shows how the &quot;artful glimpse&quot; 
  (William Trevor’s words) can often evoke a stunning panorama. Economy, economy, 
  economy of detail and vision create a wealth, wealth, wealth. (Madeleine Blais) 
  The prototype--and paragon--of the modern celebrity profile. Current efforts 
  all pale by comparison. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1966 <B>H.D. Quigg. UPI Sunday reprise of Charles Joseph Whitman’s shooting 
  from a bell tower</B> on the University of Texas campus. A very early example 
  of tick-tock journalism and very well done. (Paul Harral)</P>
<P>____1966 <B>Jean Stafford. &quot;A Woman in History.&quot; </B>Same comment 
  as for Joseph Mitchell on &quot;Mohawks in High Steel&quot;: Has had an enduring 
  shelf life, perhaps because a fierce literary sensibility was visited on the 
  real world. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1966<B> Studs Terkel. &quot;Division Street: America.&quot;</B> His first 
  book, the one in which he invented his form. Romantic in the Chicago tradition 
  of Sandburg and Dreiser, but impressive. (Todd Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1967. <B>Nick Kotz. Bad Meat.</B> Reported on unsanitary conditions in 
  the meat-packing industry for the <I>Des Moines Register</I>. His findings, 
  including the disclosure of a 1962 government report, led to the passage of 
  the Federal Wholesome Meat Act of 1967. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1967 <B>John McPhee. &quot;Oranges.&quot;</B> Fine example of what McPhee 
  does: connect, explore, get close, closer, closest. And of course the writing 
  sings. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1967 <B>J. Anthony Lukas. &quot;The Two Worlds of Linda Fitzpatrick.&quot;</B> 
  In the New York Times. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1967 <B><I>Riverside (Ca.) Press-Enterprise</I>. Uncovering corruption 
  in handling Indian estates. </B>The investigation led to convictions and clsoer 
  monitoring of these estates by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Pulitzer 1968. 
  (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1967<B> Frederick Wiseman. &quot;Titicut Follies.&quot;</B> Documentary 
  of life in a mental hospital. The ultimate cinema-verite style/fly-on-the-wall 
  style documentary. Wiseman shoots hours of footage and then edits it down with 
  no narration. (Marcia Rock) The texture of everyday life in institutions. (Todd 
  Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1967<B> John Sack. &quot;M.&quot;</B> I don’t think anyone captured the 
  soldier’s-eye view of Vietnam better. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1967 <B>D.A. Pennebaker. &quot;Don’t Look Back.&quot;</B> The 1965 Dylan 
  tour of England. A pungent revelation of &quot;attitude&quot; before there was 
  a name or an institution for it. Catches the hysteria of youth culture, and 
  the excitement of it. (Todd Gitlin) </P>
<P>____1968 <B>Frederick Wiseman. &quot;High School.&quot;</B> The texture of 
  everyday life in institutions. (Todd Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Tom Wolfe. &quot;Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.&quot;</B> By far 
  the best book written about the 60s counterculture; yet it transcends its immediate 
  subject matter to illuminate larger themes of religious experience and American 
  myth-making. Wolfe combines his usual virtuoso reporting with an uncanny ability 
  to articulate an experience whose fundamental power is beyond words; and in 
  recounting the Pranksters’ spiritual quest he manages to combine unfailing empathy 
  with unfailing critical distance. (Ellen Willis) I frankly don’t know how much 
  of a recreation this is, but it feels fundamentally true to me (and I’ve never 
  seen its truth contested). (Todd Gitlin) Here, Wolfe takes Capote’s innovation 
  in narrative journalism and supercharges it. A piece of pure journalistic performance. 
  (Ben Yagoda) If one of the purposes of journalism is to help us enter new worlds, 
  Wolfe did it as well here as it has ever been done. He got something very bizarre, 
  but very influential, very right. And the writing itself is also eye-opening. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Gary Wills. &quot;Martin Luther King Is Still on the Case.&quot;</B> 
  From <I>Esquire</I>. One of the great magazine pieces from the civil rights 
  movement. Maybe <I>the</I> great. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Walter Cronkite. Documentary on Vietnam.</B> (Michael Ludlum, Richard 
  Petrow) An important moment in journalism history. Today, it still provokes 
  much analysis. Did it influence Lyndon Johnson’s bombshell decision in March 
  to reject another run for the presidency? Did it influence American public opinion 
  or did it more accurately reflect growing antiwar sentiment? (Garry Gilbert) 
  This CBS broadcast convinced President Johnson that he had lost the country. 
  (Mitchell Stephens) </P>
<P>____1968 <B>Joan Didion. &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; (collected 
  essays).</B> Having apparently received a transfusion of DNA from Montaigne 
  at birth, Didion went on to become a master of the kind of sentence with rises 
  and falls with surprising fillips and grand finales that qualify as a kind of 
  music. Marry this grand style with her down-to-earth subject matter and the 
  union is unforgettable. (Madeleine Blais) A good chunk of the ‘60s in one slim 
  book. (Lamar Graham) For seeing the dark side of the 60s and forecasting the 
  culture wars of today. (Jay Rosen) A collection of her searching, often nasty, 
  often lovely cultural excursions. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Albert and David Maysles. &quot;Salesman.&quot;</B> Bible salesmen. 
  Cinema verite style where filmmakers go walking with the salesmen. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Norman Mailer. &quot;The Armies of the Night.&quot;</B> (Todd Gitlin, 
  Ellen Willis) When everyone else was discovering the first person, Mailer was 
  discovering the third, in this tour de force of neo-Victorian prose. (Ben Yagoda) 
  For great writing in the participant/observer mode. Will stand the test of time. 
  (Jay Rosen) Is there a better book about the anti-war movement of the ‘60s? 
  (Lamar Graham) Packed tight with observations, revelations, thoughts. (Mitchell 
  Stephens)</P>
<P>____1968 <B>Eddie Adams and Vo Suu. Photograph of a Saigon execution.</B> An 
  AP photographer and an NBC cameraman both captured the summary execution of 
  a Viet Cong guerrilla by a South Vietnamese general during the Tet offensive. 
  The image that probably did most to turn the public against the war. (Mitchell 
  Stephens) Along with that pic of a little girl running naked down a road after 
  a napalm attack, Adams’ image of an ARVN general blowing away his prisoner is 
  arguably the most recognizable image of the war in Viet Nam. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1969 <B>Joe McGinniss. The Selling of the Presidency, 1968.</B> McGinniss 
  conveys an inside view of the marketing of a presidential candidate, Richard 
  Nixon, to the American voters. The revelations might well evince a yawn today, 
  but 30 years ago it was an eye-opener--and a first. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1969<B> Seymour Hersh. Investigation of massacre committed by American 
  soldiers at My Lai</B> in Vietnam. (Richard Petrow) What other story brought 
  home the horror of Vietnam better? (Lamar Graham) One reporter; unaffiliated; 
  unable, originally, to sell the story to the mainstream media. But he got it 
  right; the mainstream belatedly followed. Among the loudest of the questions 
  raised about the American war effort. (Mitchell Stephens) Hersh uncovered a 
  massacre perpetrated by American troops against Vietnamese civilians. His painstaking 
  investigation was a factor in turning American attitudes against the war. (Stephen 
  Solomon)</P>
<P>____1969 <B>D.A. Pennebaker. &quot;Monterey Pop.&quot;</B> Rock innocence, 
  excitement before the rock culture became so jaded. (Todd Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1969 <B>Pauline Kael. &quot;Trash, Art, and the Movies.&quot;</B> Eloquent 
  argument declaring the independence of movies from the tyranny of &quot;art&quot; 
  defined as what the authorities say is good for you and opting instead for a 
  conception of popular art? trash? whatever valued for its compex and various 
  contributions to the audience’s pleasure and the heightening and intensification 
  of experience. In resisting the &quot;auteur theory&quot; and its attempt to 
  coopt movies into the ranks of high culture, Kael’s work in general, and this 
  piece in particular, were insturmential in articulating an aesthetic of mass 
  culture as having its own distinctive properties and virtues, and had a powerful 
  influence on younger cultural critics. (Ellen Willis)</P>
<P>____1969 <B>Walter Cronkite. Coverage of the space flight that put a man on 
  the moon.</B> Cronkite’s preparation was extensive and it showed. He provided 
  knowledgeable insights on the astronauts and the technology involved. His reporting 
  style complemented the significance and drama of the occasion without intruding 
  on its innate newsworthiness. (Michael Ludlum)</P>
<P>____1970 <B>William Jones. &quot;Sadism Rides an Ambulance.&quot;</B> Reports 
  in the Chicago Tribune of awful brutality by an ambulance driver of his charges. 
  Jones went undercover as an ambulance worker himself and exposed such things 
  as making a heart attack victim walk to her stretcher. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1970 <B>Gay Talese. &quot;Fame and Obscurity: Portraits by Gay Talese </B>Contains 
  a large chunk of what I consider his best work, including his 1964 book &quot;The 
  Bridge,&quot; on the construction of the Verrazano, and his classic profiles 
  of Frank Sinatra, Joe DiMaggio, and Joe Louis. One of the two (the other being 
  Tom Wolfe) most influential New Journalists, creating a genre of literary journalism 
  that combines the use of novelistic techniques with in-depth saturation reporting. 
  Along with Wolfe, is dedicated to showing that reporting is a conscious aesthetic 
  endeavor, not a mechanical conveyor belt between fact and reader. A master of 
  nuanced, mind-bogglingly thorough observation, narrative reconstruction of events, 
  and depiction of character through the revelatory scene, action, piece of dialogue. 
  (Ellen Willis) Few have gotten more from scenes; legwork; polished, formal writing. 
  (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1970 <B>Hunter S. Thompson. &quot;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved.&quot;</B> 
  The piece in which he establishes his inverted but oddly effective variety of 
  journalism: unleashing fantasy in search of truth. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1970 <B>Tom Wolfe. &quot;Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.&quot;</B> 
  (Todd Gitlin) Energetic and iconoclastic, this essay remains a standard bearer 
  for the New Journalism. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1971 <B><I>New York Times</I>. Publication of the Pentagon Papers.</B> 
  The Nixon administration tried to block the <I>New York Times</I> from printing 
  the papers, but the United States Supreme Court ruled that the government may 
  not exercise &quot;prior restraint.&quot; (David Mindich) Publication of the 
  Pentagon Papers precipitated a prior restraint against the <I>Times</I> and 
  the <I>Post</I> and a landmark Supreme Court decision on the rights of the press. 
  (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1971 <B>Jon Nordheimer &quot;From Dakto to Detroit: death of a Troubled 
  Hero.&quot;</B> Brilliant, under-reprinted account in <I>New York Times </I>of 
  a black Congressional Medal of Honor winner (Vietnam) who was killed while trying 
  to rob a grocery store. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1971-99 <B>Bill Moyers. &quot;Bill Moyers Journal.&quot;</B> Series of 
  programs bringing intelligence and a nuanced understanding of American life 
  to TV. (Richard Petrow)</P>
<P>____1971<B> Peter Davis. &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon.&quot;</B> CBS News 
  documentary. (Marcia Rock) Few network television documentaries have had the 
  courage to investigate the government, let alone the Pentagon; few have succeeded 
  in shaking things up. This one did. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1971 <B>Norman Mailer. &quot;Of a Fire on the Moon.&quot;</B> What can 
  you say? He goes to the core. When the subject is right, his subjectivity transcends 
  itself. (Todd Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1972 <B>Huyn Cong Ut. Photograph of a burning girl running from a napalm 
  attack.</B> Unforgettable image. The horror of war, this war. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1972 <B>Timothy Crouse. &quot;Boys on the Bus.&quot;</B> Reporting on reporters. 
  No one has done it better. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1972 <B>Roger Kahn. &quot;Boys of Summer.&quot;</B> The afterlife of athletes, 
  beautifully told. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1972-73 <B>Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Watergate investigations</B> 
  for the <I>Washington Post</I>. (Jay Rosen) And the president resigned. (Mitchell 
  Stephens) Can we even conceive of what’s happening to Clinton had it not been 
  for what happened to Nixon? (Lamar Graham) The Woodward and Bernstein pieces 
  are an example of investigative reporting at its very best, a standard by which 
  all other efforts are measured. The <I>Post </I>articles unraveled the Watergate 
  scandal and brought down Richard Nixon’s presidency. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1973 <B>Hunter S. Thompson. &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.&quot;</B> 
  The cacophony of a presidential campaign—with the volume turned up. He found 
  a kind of truth amidst the madness, through the madness. (Mitchell Stephens) 
  You can’t talk about ‘60s/’70s journalism without talking about Thompson, and 
  this work collects his best (even though I personally prefer &quot;Hell’s Angels&quot;). 
  (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1973 <B>Joe Esztherhas. &quot;Charlie Simpson’s Apocalypse.&quot;</B> Originally 
  published in <I>Rolling Stone</I>. Arguably the story that put that magazine 
  on the map as a journalistic vehicle. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1973 <B>Robert Christgau. &quot;Any Old Way You Choose It.&quot;</B> This 
  pioneering collection of <I>Esquire, Voice</I> and <I>Newsday</I> essays and 
  reviews on pop music never got the attention it deserves; it is now out of print 
  and not even in the NYU library. The articles it consists of, however, have 
  had an enormous impact, not only in shaping a new critical genre--pop music 
  criticism--but by introducing into cultural journalism, in lucid and passionate 
  prose, many of the insights about the dissolving boundaries between art and 
  life later recycled by the academy, couched in impenetrable jargon, and labeled 
  &quot;postmodernism.&quot; (Ellen Willis)</P>
<P>____1973 <B>Don Bartlett and James B. Steele. &quot;Oil: The Created Crisis.&quot;</B> 
  The <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I>. Arguably their best. So out in front of the 
  story that acclaim came mostly a year after they wrote the series and too late 
  for a Pulitzer. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1974 <B>Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. &quot;All the President’s Men.&quot;</B> 
  (Lamar Graham) As much as this book is about government and power and its temptations, 
  it is also about reporting and power and its temptations. (Madeleine Blais) 
</P>
<P>____1975 <B>Nora Ephron. &quot;Crazy Salad.&quot;</B> Women’s lives and traditional 
  housewife culture exposed with great wit. (Mitchell Stephens) </P>
<P>____1975<B> Frederick Wiseman. &quot;Welfare.&quot;</B> The texture of everyday 
  life in institutions. (Todd Gitlin) This documentary, broadcast on PBS, was 
  cinema verite at its most powerful. Activities inside a New York City welfare 
  office in remarkably tight focus. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1975 <B>Peter Davis. &quot;Hearts and Minds.&quot;</B> (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1975 <B>Greil Marcus. &quot;Mystery Train.&quot;</B> The definitive exploration 
  of rock and roll as American culture—or rather the American drama acted out 
  by its rock and roll performers—particularly the tour de force of its last chapter, 
  &quot;Presliad.&quot; Its prose, as I wrote in my New Yorker review, by turns 
  &quot;attains an elegiac eloquence that echoes the blues&quot; and is &quot;pure 
  effluvium of pop, crammed with digressions and amplifications and throwaway 
  insights and the endless bits of information a fan can’t bear to leave out.&quot; 
  (Ellen Willis)</P>
<P>____1976 <B>Karen Durbin. &quot;On Being a Woman Alone.&quot; </B>Durbin’s 
  groundbreaking personal essays in the <I>Village Voice</I> are early models 
  of a genre of female memoir that has since become fashionable (and too often 
  formulaic). She was relentlessly attacked for being &quot;confessional&quot; 
  and &quot;narcissistic&quot; and writing about her lovers. But for her admirers, 
  including me, her work is notable for its honesty, lack of sentimentality, and 
  fidelity to the ambiguity and complexity of real messy life, as well as a feminist 
  politics that emphasizes freedom—material, sexual and emotional. Her moments 
  of illumination are always earned, never contrived, nor do they ever pretend 
  to ultimately settle anything. This one in my view is her best. (Ellen Willis)</P>
<P>____1976 <B>C.B.D. Bryan. &quot;Friendly Fire.&quot;</B> A book that has the 
  same impact as the Viet Nam Memorial in Washington. It is as elegant and solid, 
  as well. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1977 <B>John McPhee. &quot;The John McPhee Reader.&quot;</B> (Richard Petrow) 
  No one McPhee work stands out above the others, but he deserves to be on the 
  list because of his reportorial creativity, his structural ingenuity and his 
  understated humor. This is a marvelous anthology from his best period. (Ben 
  Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1977 <B>Alan and Susan Raymond. &quot;Police Tapes.&quot;</B> Cinema verite 
  style documentary that presages 48 Hours and other reality programs that put 
  the camera on the shoulder and went riding with cops. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1977 <B>Philip Caputo. &quot;Rumor of War.&quot;</B> This is one of the 
  most subtle, moving, frustrating and beautiful memoirs of men at war ever written. 
  It captures all the hope that went into the war and all the despair that emerged 
  in uncompromising prose. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1977 <B>Michael Herr. &quot;Dispatches.&quot;</B> Poetic and mundane, this 
  work captures the essential contradictory nature of our involvement in Vietnam. 
  (Madeleine Blais) Writing so powerful it takes your breath away. The classic 
  book of Vietnam journalism. (Ben Yagoda) The one book from the new journalism 
  that will always stand up as factual observation using the style of fiction. 
  (Jay Rosen) The single most compelling book about </P>
<P>Vietnam ever written, in my opinion. (Lamar Graham) Jumpy, haunted and shattering—like 
  some rock music, like this war. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1978 <B>Gaylord Shaw. &quot;Dams: A Question of Safety&quot;</B> series 
  for the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>. Shaw’s articles led to a huge federal investigation 
  of dams nationwide. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1978 <B>Errol Morris. &quot;Gates of Heaven.&quot;</B> The pet cemetery 
  and people who care about it. Amazing Americana, respectful of crankiness. (Todd 
  Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong.</B> &quot;<B>The Brethren.&quot; 
  </B>This was an extensive inside look at how the U.S. Supreme Court operates. 
  Significantly, the book illuminated the inner workings of one of our three branches 
  of government that until then had been closed to view. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1979<B> Ira Wohl. &quot;Best Boy.&quot;</B> (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Dave and Cathy Mitchell. Reporting on Synanon.</B> Two reporters 
  who had recently bought a small California paper, the <I>Point Reyes Light,</I> 
  undertook an investigation that uncovered the bizarre dealings of a nearby cult, 
  Synanon. Their efforts won them a Pulitzer. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Michele Wallace. &quot;Black Macho and the Myth of Superwoman.&quot;</B> 
  Book at first so vilified by its intended beneficiaries that you knew it had 
  to be hitting a nerve. Started a debate on race and feminism that has never 
  stopped. Every black feminist from bell hooks to Lisa Jones bears her imprint. 
  (Ellen Willis)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Thomas Ferrick, Jr., Susan Q. Stanahan, Joel N. Shurkin, et. al. 
  The <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I>’s reconstruction of the Three Mile Island nuclear 
  accident. </B>(Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Hunter S. Thompson. &quot;The Great Shark Hunt.&quot;</B> You can’t 
  talk about ‘60s/’70s journalism without talking about Thompson, and this is 
  a second work that collects his best (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1979<B> Tom Wolfe. &quot;The Right Stuff.&quot;</B> (Gene Roberts) Another 
  tight, insular culture opened, with great style and humor. (Mitchell Stephens) 
  Stylish and well written, this is the best there is about space and the fighter 
  jocks who took us there. (Stephen Solomon)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>Norman Mailer. &quot;The Executioner’s Song.&quot;</B> A meticulous 
  work of sociology, psychology, legal studies, and literature. The standard bearer 
  for a certain kind of true crime journalism. Among my top candidates for a time 
  capsule to be opened at the end of the next millenium. (Madeleine Blais) The 
  first half of this book settles as deeply into the language of strangers as 
  any work of nonfiction I have read. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1979 <B>David Halberstam. &quot;The Powers That Be.&quot;</B> (Pamela Newkirk)</P>
<P>____1980 <B>Richard Ben Cramer. Account of the capture and death of a Russian 
  lieutenant by Afghan guerillas during the war in Afghanistan.</B> For the <I>Philadelphia 
  Inquirer</I>. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1981 <B>Paul Fussell. &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb.&quot;</B> A brilliant 
  essay by one of our great contrarians. (Michael Ludlum)</P>
<P>____1981 <B>Pierre Salinger. &quot;America Held Hostage: The Secret Negotiations.&quot;</B> 
  ABC documentary provided significant insight into what had gone on behind the 
  scenes during the Iranian hostage crisis. (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1981 <B>Tracy Kidder. &quot;The Soul of a New Machine.&quot;</B> Technology 
  made human (and for some, therefore all the more terrifying) in an elegant prose 
  style. (Madeleine Blais) Early journalism about the computer. Clear and compelling 
  about the complex. Unfortunately this particular computer soon became an outdated 
  machine. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1981-85 <B>Randy Shilts. Reporting on AIDS.</B> Shilts was one of the only 
  reporters in the country to report on emerging AIDS crisis. Through his reports 
  in the <I>San Francisco Chronicle, </I>bathhouses were closed and health authorities 
  were forced to confront the epidemic. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1982 <B>Loren Jenkens. Coverage of the massacre at the Sabra and Chatilla 
  refugee camps</B> in Lebanon. The <I>Washington Post</I>’s Jenkens shared the 
  Pulitzer with Tom Friedman of the <I>New York Times,</I> but the <I>Post</I>’s 
  coverage was much better. (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1982 <B>Susan Sheehan. &quot;Is There No Place on Earth for Me?&quot;</B> 
  By telling the story of a mental patient by the name of Sylvia Frumpkin in a 
  torrent of detail, the relentlessness of her disease and the inadequacy of the 
  people charged with her care remains a stunning example of how even the most 
  marginal life is filled with significance if only we are prepared to use our 
  eyes and heart to see. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1982 <B>Russell Baker. &quot;Growing Up.&quot;</B> Wry, self-deprecating, 
  this story of a family trying to survive during the Depression is also a psalm 
  to newspapers and everything they used to represent when print was king. The 
  chapter of the correspondence between Baker’s widowed mother and the German 
  baker is a great archive in and of itself. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1982 <B>Roger Rosenblatt. &quot;Children of War.&quot;</B> Time cover story. 
  Combined great reporting and writing with the best of photojournalism. (Barrett 
  Seaman)</P>
<P>____1982 <B>Jayne Loader and Kevine and Pierce Rafferty. &quot;Atomic Cafe.&quot;</B> 
  Clips from the 50s describing the hysteria aroused by the bomb. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1984 <B>Michael Apted. &quot;28 Up.&quot;</B> (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1985 <B>Ted Koppel. &quot;Nightline&quot; (ABC) broadcast from South Africa.</B> 
  The first time the white government ever engaged black South Africans in public 
  discussion. Koppel was making history, and using television journalism to do 
  it. (Jay Rosen)</P>
<P>____1985 <B>ABC. Coverage of the hijacking of TWA 847.</B> The tarmac interview 
  of Capt. John Testrake reamins one of the most memorable images in recent years. 
  Also, this coverage was one of the few examples of the media serving as a means 
  of communication between terrorists and government officials. In part of the 
  ABC coverage, only one person died in what was a delicate diplomatic situation. 
  (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1985 <B>J.</B> <B>Anthony Lukas. &quot;Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade 
  in the Lives of Three American Families.&quot;</B> (Gene Roberts) Tackles the 
  most divisive issues of our time--race and class--in a reportorial format. (Jay 
  Rosen) Like &quot;The Executioner’s Song,&quot; this book defies boundaries 
  of history and sociology and urban studies to create its own new category. Using 
  the prism of three families, Lukas cuts back and forth in the present and the 
  past to show how a current event, the busing crisis in Boston in the early seventies, 
  has clear and tragic roots in the imprisoning past. (Madeleine Blais) A great 
  and powerful work of journalism, derived using the classic methods of journalism 
  (extensive interviews and observation, along with background research), but 
  a work that also has become an important work of history, even though the events 
  it describes were in the very recent past when Lukas wrote about them. Through 
  the lives of three Boston families, Lukas reveals the complexity and the depth 
  of anguish that the busing crisis of the 1970s created, and that the social 
  problems that busing was trying to address also created. (Alan Brinkley)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>Tim O’Brien. &quot;The Things We Carry.&quot;</B> Goes through 
  objects (wasn’t it Wallace Stephens who said &quot;No ideas but in things?&quot;) 
  of a homely and sentimental nature to show us the conflict not just in the jungle 
  and the rice paddies but inside the minds and hearts of our fighting men in 
  Viet Nam. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>Ross McElwee. &quot;Sherman’s March.&quot;</B> A personal documentary 
  that uses Sherman’s path to retrace his own family history. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>Steve Twomey. &quot;How Super Are Our Supercarriers?&quot;</B> 
  Appeared in the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine</I>. Awesome story movement 
  and description. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>Sally Tisdale. &quot;We Do Abortions Here.&quot;</B> Appeared in 
  <I>Harper’s.</I> </P>
<P>Confronts, with grace but without flinching, emotions surrounding the act of 
  abortion.<I> </I>(Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>Bill Moyers. &quot;The Vanishing Family--Crisis in Black America.&quot;</B> 
  Moyers explores the break-down of the black family. His interviews with teen 
  moms and dads are superb. DuPont Silver Baton. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1986 <B>David Shipler. &quot;Arab and Jew.&quot;</B> (Richard Petrow)</P>
<P>____1987 <B>James Gleiek. &quot;Chaos: Making a New Science.&quot;</B> Announced 
  the arrival of a new science remarkably early and sufficiently loudly and clearly 
  that that announcement continues to reverberate. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1987 <B>Henry Hampton. &quot;Eyes on the Prize.&quot;</B> Marvelous choice 
  of film sequences, talking hears (e.g. the Little Rock high school integrators, 
  now middle-aged and articulate. The second sequence falls down (too uncritical 
  of the Black Panthers), but the first eight episodes or so are superb. (Todd 
  Gitlin) Dramatic and moving account of the civil rights movement. A great work 
  of journalism. (Pamela Newkirk)</P>
<P>____1987 <B>Sylvester Monroe and Peter Goldman. &quot;Brothers.&quot;</B> In 
  <I>Newsweek</I>. A fascinating look at Monroe’s old ghetto neighborhood in Chicago 
  and what had happened to his old friends. (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>Ted Koppel. &quot;Nightline&quot; (ABC) broadcast from Israel.</B> 
  Koppel and company got Israeli and Palestinian leaders together for the first 
  time ever in a public forum. Koppel was making history, and using television 
  journalism to do it. (Jay Rosen)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>Errol Morris. &quot;The Thin Blue Line.&quot;</B> Amazing use of 
  interviews and music to explore the question of what actually happened in a 
  Texas murder. (Todd Gitlin) Morris’s best. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>P.J. O’Rourke. &quot;Holidays in Hell.&quot;</B> Travel writing 
  turned upside-down. &quot;When the kid in the front row at the rally bit off 
  the tip of his little finger and wrote, KIM DAE JUNG, in blood on his fancy 
  white ski jacket--I think that was the first time I ever really felt like a 
  foreign correspondent. I mean, here was something really fucking <I>foreign</I>.&quot; 
  (Mary Sisson)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>Don Barlett and James B. Steele. &quot;The Great Tax Giveaway&quot;</B> 
  series for the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I>. Won the Pulitzer for national reporting. 
  (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>Taylor Branch. &quot;Parting the Waters.&quot;</B> The history 
  of the civil-rights struggle is all here, and more. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>Neil Sheehan. &quot;A Bright Shining Lie.&quot;</B> Sheehan brilliantly 
  reconstructs the tragic life of one of the most illuminating figures of the 
  Vietnam War, and in the process exposes--through the medium of a powerfully 
  narrated story--many of the most basic problems and issues of that war. Sheehan’s 
  book is, of course, of historical importance, but it is at heart a work of journalism, 
  derived largely from Sheehan’s own experiences in Vietnam and from extensive 
  interviews with others. (Alan Brinkley)</P>
<P>____1988 <B>David Remnick. &quot;In Spitak, Survivors Comb Ruins of Devastated 
  Town.&quot;</B> News reporting for the <I>Washington Post</I>. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1989 <B>Thomas Friedman. &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem.&quot;</B> (Mitchell 
  Stephens)</P>
<P>____1989<B> Ian Frazier. &quot;Great Plains.&quot;</B> Frazier’s profile of 
  a much-traveled-over piece of America makes quirkiness into an art form. (Ben 
  Yagoda)</P>
<P>____1989 <B>Marlon Riggs. &quot;Tongues Untied.&quot;</B> Deliberately scadalous 
  symphony of revelation about a gay black man. Inventive and funny. (Todd Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1989 <B><I>Time</I>. &quot;The Endangered Earth&quot; issue.</B> A variation 
  of <I>Time</I>’s traditional Man of the Year. Dramatically presented, it offered 
  a troubling diagnosis of the planet’s environmental condition. (Barrett Seaman)</P>
<P>____1990 <B>Timothy Garton Ash. &quot;The Magic Lantern.&quot;</B> Reports 
  on the velvet revolutions in Prague and Eastern Europe for the <I>New York Review 
  of Books</I>. This book collects the best of those pieces. One of the decisive 
  dates of the century, the year 1989, is brilliantly chronicled here. (Jay Rosen)</P>
<P>____1991 <B>Peter Arnett. Coverage of Persian Gulf War.</B> His coverage from 
  Baghdad provided viewers with material from the other side of the war--a rare 
  event in most combats. He kept information flowing despite facing censorship. 
  (Christopher Harper)</P>
<P>____1991 <B>Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> 
  series: &quot;America: What Went Wrong.&quot;</B> Grass roots economics. Paper 
  prints 400,000 extra copies. (Mitchell Stephens)</P>
<P>____1991 <B>Melissa Fay Greene. &quot;Praying for Sheetrock.&quot;</B> A brilliantly 
  executed look at racism and justice delayed, justice denied in the South with 
  a beautifully rendered sense of place. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1991 <B>Nicholas Lemann. &quot;The Promised Land.&quot;</B> Like &quot;Common 
  Ground,&quot; from which it probably drew considerable inspiration, Lemann’s 
  book is a monumental study of a part of American life that few of even the most 
  intrepid journalists choose to examine. It looks squarely and courageously at 
  the lives of several desperately poor families in one of the nation’s most degraded 
  communities. Lemann lived and worked with these people for many months, under 
  conditions that few other reporters would consider enduring. And his findings, 
  controversial though some of them are, give us the most vivid picture available 
  to a non-scholarly audience of how the so-called underclass emerged and how 
  they live. There is, of course, a more conventionally historical section of 
  the book--the story of the emergence of the Great Society, but it is the re-creation 
  of the lives of the inner-city poor that makes this such an important work. 
  (Alan Brinkley)</P>
<P>____1992<B> Norman McLean. &quot;Young Men and Fire.&quot;</B> Perhaps the 
  greatest opening paragraph in all of modern non-fiction. And unforgettable, 
  when the elderly McLean struggles up the steep sides of the Mann Gulch trying 
  to imagine what was in the minds of the smokejumpers as they raced against the 
  flames behind them 50 years earlier. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1992 <B>Maria Henson. &quot;To Have and to Harm, Kentucky’s Failure to 
  Protect Women From the Men who Beat Them&quot; editorials.</B> The <I>Lexington 
  (KY) Herald-Leader</I> editorials led to an increased awareness of wife beating 
  and to the passage of new laws that protected victims and opened files of domestic 
  violence complaints, and other advances. (David Mindich) </P>
<P>____1992 <B>Richard Ben Cramer. &quot;What It Takes: The Road to the White 
  House.&quot;</B> (Gene Roberts) A virtuoso account of seven candidates’ attempts 
  to win the presidency in 1988. Not your father’s Teddy White. (Ben Yagoda) </P>
<P>____1992<B> Joseph Mitchell. &quot;Up at the Old Hotel.&quot;</B> (Collection 
  of much older pieces.) Quirky, eccentric, and oddly joyous, this series of portraits 
  of New York City at midcentury and its inhabitants celebrates the extraordinary 
  in the lives of the ordinary people. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1992<B> Mike Toner. &quot;When Bugs Fight Back.&quot;</B> Articles on drug-resistant 
  diseases and pesticide resistant insects for the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I>. 
  The articles by Toner helped to create the awareness that pesticides and antibiotics 
  have become less and less effective as insects and infections have built up 
  resistance. William L. Roper, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, 
  wrote &quot;These articles are comprehensive, accurate and serve as an effective 
  alert to a growing public-health problem.&quot; (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1992<B> Bill Buford. &quot;Among the Thugs.&quot;</B> A fascinating look 
  at soccer hooliganism in the UK and, more broadly, the society of men and male 
  violence. A great piece of intellectual journalism--Hunter Thompson meets Susan 
  Sontag, if an analogy is required. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1993 <B>David Remnick. &quot;Lenin’s Tomb.&quot;</B> (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1993 <B>Roy Guman. Reporting on Serbian concentration camps.</B> <I>Newsday</I>’s 
  chief European correspondent was the first journalist to report in depth on 
  the Serbian concentration camps in the former Yugoslavia. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1993<B> Eileen Welsome. &quot;America’s Atomic Victims&quot; and &quot;The 
  Plutonium Experiment&quot; series</B> for the <I>Albuquerque Tribune</I>. Reports 
  on the secret U. S. experiments with plutonium that introduced to the public 
  to what Energy Secretary Hazel O’Leary called the &quot;darkest side&quot; of 
  the Cold War: government-sanctioned experiments with radioactive substances 
  on U.S. citizens. Welsome’s work pushed the Department of Energy to release 
  documents, and President Clinton convened a special meeting of federal agencies 
  involved in radiation experiments. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1993 <B>C. Carr. &quot;On Edge.&quot;</B> A collection of her <I>VillageVoice</I> 
  pieces on performance art (broadly conceived), sexually &quot;deviant&quot; 
  and sacrilegious art, art that messes with the boundaries of race and other 
  cultural categories, and the political controversies surrounding all this work. 
  On one level, an extended meditation on that vexed question, what is art, and 
  the emerging corollary question, what is criticism; on another, a powerful argument 
  about what’s at stake in what she calls the &quot;war on art.&quot; Best body 
  of journalism extant on these subjects. A convincing answer to Arlene Croce’s 
  claim that art of the Bill T Jones ilk is not amenable to criticism, written 
  before Croce made it. (Ellen Wilis)</P>
<P>____1994 <B>Rick Bragg. &quot;The Serial Diner.&quot;</B> Appeared in the <I>New 
  York Times</I>. (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1994 <B>Rick Bragg. Account for the <I>New York Times</I> of a tornado 
  demolishing a rural church during Sunday services.</B> (Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1994 <B>Steve James, Fred Marx and Peter Gilbert. &quot;Hoop Dreams.&quot;</B> 
  This documentary follows two aspiring basketball-playing inner-city youths from 
  high school to college. Great insight into what helps and what prevents these 
  young men from succeeding. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1994 <B>Tom Junod. &quot;The Abortionist.&quot;</B> Possibly the best magazine 
  piece I’ve read in at least a decade. Won <I>GQ</I> the National Magazine Award. 
  Three of the principals in the piece were shot (two mortally) by anti-abortionists 
  a month after the story came out. (Lamar Graham)</P>
<P>____1994 <B>Mikal Gilmore. &quot;Shot in the Heart.&quot;</B> Both as a companion 
  piece to &quot;The Executioner’s Song&quot; and as a work on its own, this is 
  a lyrical, brooding meditation on a hardscrabble, deeply American family which, 
  if described as merely dysfunctional, would take it as a compliment. It goes 
  a long way to explaining, though not excusing, the roots of criminality in a 
  culture that seems to take delight in exacerbating antisocial tendancies. (Madeleine 
  Blais)</P>
<P>____1994 <B><I>The Akron Beacon Journal</I>. &quot;A Question of Color&quot;</B> 
  series of extended reports on race relations. The newspaper devoted 29 reporters, 
  photographers, artists, and editors for the better part of the year to a series 
  of articles about race relations. The series examined many aspects of race relations 
  within Akron and in the nation in general. A newspaper-sponsored effort, called 
  &quot;Coming Together,&quot; initiated dialogue between the races in the Akron 
  area and has become a model for &quot;public&quot; journalism. (David Mindich)</P>
<P>____1995 <B>Rick Bragg. &quot;All She Has, $150,000, Is Going to a University.&quot;</B> 
  Appeared in the <I>New York Times. </I>(Gene Roberts)</P>
<P>____1995 <B>Jonathan Harr. &quot;A Civil Action.&quot;</B> This is a compelling 
  legal drama about a battle between bereaved parents and the corporations whose 
  pollution may have killed their children. Few accounts have captured the drama 
  and inner workings of the legal system as well. It is assigned reading in many 
  law schools. (Stephen Solomon) </P>
<P>____1996 <B>Frank McCourt. &quot;Angela’s Ashes.&quot;</B> The immigrant’s 
  experience in reverse, this work reinvents the uses and possibilities of voice. 
  A kind of odd miracle occurs when reading this book: although almost none of 
  the particulars of this man’s life apply to the reader, it feels in the end 
  as if they all do. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1996 <B>Leon Gast. &quot;When We Were Kings.&quot;</B> Documentary on Mohammed 
  Ali. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1996 <B>James Carroll. &quot;An American Requiem: God, My Father and the 
  War that Came Between Us.&quot;</B> Using his own biography as the son of a 
  brigadier general and as a pacifist ex-priest, Carroll brings the war home, 
  transcending the pitfalls of memoir and creating a universal story out of his 
  experience. (Madeleine Blais)</P>
<P>____1997 <B>Joseph Dorman. &quot;Arguing the World.&quot;</B> New York intellectuals 
  Irving Howe, Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer. The only documentary 
  I’ve ever seen that shows intellectual life as something interesting. (Todd 
  Gitlin)</P>
<P>____1997 <B>Alan Berliner. &quot;Nobody’s Business.&quot;</B> A graceful study 
  of family and memory mainly through a superb interview with Berliner’s father. 
  Emmy 1998. Generations collide as Berliner drags his reluctant father kicking 
  and screaming down memory lane to probe the swirl of conflicts and affections 
  that bind every family. What emerges is a stunningly rich portrait that finds 
  both humor and pathos in Berliner’s obsession with boundaries of personal and 
  collective memory. (Marcia Rock)</P>
<P>____1998<B> David Halberstam. &quot;The Children.&quot;</B> (Pamela Newkirk)</P>
