<P align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3" color="#FF0080">Hopes 
  for a new century.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The case can be made that 
  the media, in general, became the most powerful institution of the past century…and 
  that journalism, in particular, established itself as the form of communication 
  best able to capture the struggles of that century.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Here are twelve, rather 
  different hopes for media and journalism in the new century:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">First, that technology 
    will not make communicating seem so easy that we are unprepared for the inevitable 
    and repeated realization that really communicating is hard.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Second, that media and 
    journalism won’t continue to grow so large, so powerful and so pervasive that 
    we continue to lose our abilities to entertain and inform ourselves.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Third hope for the new 
    century, that if newspapers do finally succumb to the competition with newer 
    technologies, whatever replaces them will be damn good. And that whatever 
    may replace newspapers will be portable enough to peruse with breakfast, in 
    bed…wherever.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Fourth, that we and 
    our children and grandchildren will have the luxury of living in less and 
    less newsworthy times. That, in other words, journalism may not be the form 
    that best captures the twenty-first century.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Fifth, that, even should 
    we be so fortunate, humankind will retain sufficient interest in civic affairs 
    to prevent news from being totally overwhelmed by entertainment.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But, sixth, that the 
    exploration of kinds of news that go beyond civic affairs will continue to 
    broaden and deepen.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And, seventh, that, 
    even if times are good for many, journalists will not lose the critical spirit 
    that might help make them better for more.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Eighth hope for the 
    new century, that digital and video communication will begin to achieve the 
    revolutions not only in art but in thought that writing and printing -- after 
    similarly inauspicious starts -- achieved.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Ninth, that humankind 
    will discover – in art, in thought – new methods of mixing its mushrooming 
    doubt with invigorating, if circumscribed, conviction.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Tenth, that knowledge 
    will not only be distributed but organized and accessed with such efficiency 
    that humankind’s attachment to myths and superstitions will further weaken. 
    </font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But, eleventh, that 
    the flood of facts won’t wash away the seeds of ideas.</font></LI>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And, twelfth, that no 
    amount of information will lessen our awe and astonishment at the wonder of 
    our existence.</font></LI>
</UL>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Happy new century!</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&nbsp;</font></P>
