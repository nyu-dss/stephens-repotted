  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THE
  WORLD'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL LIVING philosopher, arguably its most
  controversial living thinker, is sitting at a concrete picnic
  table at an outdoor snack bar at UC Irvine. Few of the
  undergraduates who stroll by in jams or jeans seem to notice
  Jacques Derrida, with his carefully tailored gray suit and purple
  tie. Few would recognize his name if they were introduced. * But
  as Derrida sips his coffee from a plastic cup, a crowd of
  world-class graduate students and star professors from as far
  away as China is already hustling for the best seats in his
  classroom. In a few minutes, Derrida will present two immensely
  difficult hours on the latest applications of his renowned method
  -- deconstruction -- and that room full of scholars will barely
  allow itself a cough. * Echoes of Derrida's ideas can now be
  heard in the most unlikely places. The word deconstruction
  (albeit shorn of much of its meaning) now appears in newspaper
  reviews and at dinner parties: "Let's deconstruct this scene." It
  is becoming, like existentialism before it, a part of the
  language -- to the point where a State Department official can
  speak of a plan for the "deconstruction" of part of the American
  Embassy in Moscow, and Mick Jagger can ask, "Does anyone really
  know what deconstructivist means?"("Deconstructivist" has been
  the most controversial variety of architecture in recent years.)
  But the main impact of Derrida's method has been felt on college
  campuses. * Deconstruction -- which Derrida gave birth to in
  Paris in the 1960s -- swept through American universities in the
  '70s and '80s, presuming to remake nothing less than the way
  professors and students perform their most basic activity:
  reading.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Deconstructive readings focus -- intently, obsessively -- on
  the metaphors writers use to make their points. Their purpose is
  to demonstrate, through comparisons of a work's arguments and its
  metaphors, that writers contradict themselves -- not just
  occasionally, but invariably -- and that these contradictions
  reflect deep fissures in the very foundations of Western culture.
  In other words, deconstruction claims to have uncovered serious
  problems in the way Plato and Hemingway and you and I think about
  matters ranging from truth and friendship to politics and
  masturbation. Such suggestions have, to say the least, proved
  controversial. University departments and scholarly associations
  have split in two over Derrida's complex, often misunderstood
  method. Friendships have been ruined. His followers tell tales of
  enlightenment: "It was a little like the moment when Helen Keller
  first understands the connection between the signing she is being
  taught and meaning," recalls Harvard English Department's Barbara
  Johnson of her first encounter with Derrida and deconstruction
  while a graduate student at Yale. "Keller wanted to go back and
  sign everything; I wanted to reread everything," Johnson says.
  But those academics who remain unconverted call Derrida's
  movement a "cult" or even a "fraud." * "Deconstruction has rather
  obvious and manifest intellectual weaknesses," writes Berkeley
  philosophy professor John Searle. "It should be fairly obvious to
  the careful reader that the emperor has no clothes." * When
  Irvine displaced Yale as Derrida's main American base four years
  ago (paying him more than $30,000 a year for an academic quarter
  compressed into five weeks), there were, along with the proud
  press releases, predictable outbursts of hard-headed cynicism and
  fiscal outrage. The shrieks might have been louder if the
  residents of Orange County understood just how profound a
  challenge to their thought this distinguished new visiting
  professor would bring.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">DERRIDA'S
  DARK MEDITERRANEAN skin contrasts with a wide, still full frame
  of silver hair. "Striking," one of his female graduate students
  had commented, twice. The word most of his friends use to
  describe him is "gracious." "Jacques is the mildest of persons,"
  adds Yale professor Harold Bloom. Nevertheless, Derrida is
  occasionally unwilling or unable to play the roles expected of
  him. I had been warned that he would not respond well in
  particular to personal questions of the sort the subject of a
  magazine profile must face. "Ah, you want me to tell you things
  like
  'I-was-born-in-a-petit-bourgeois-Jewish-family-which-was-assimilated-but
  . . .' " is how Derrida parried one such query by a French
  magazine reporter. "Is this really necessary? I just can't do
  it," he protested to that reporter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">For a
  celebrity of sorts, Derrida is unusually private and reserved.
  "There is a certain distance," concedes the avant-garde architect
  Peter Eisenman, who collaborated with Derrida on the design for a
  garden in Paris. (Eisenman teasingly accuses Derrida of believing
  a garden ought to have some benches and trees, a charge Derrida
  vehemently denies. The design the two of them came up with -- as
  yet unbuilt -- includes no such reactionary elements.) "He's not
  the kind of guy," Eisenman notes, "to whom you say, 'Hey, come
  on, Jacques, let's go have a beer.' We sniff around each
  other."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And to
  Derrida's natural reserve -- his tendency to sniff around -- has
  been added a professional suspicion of easy answers and simple
  categories. Note, for example, the hesitations that accompany one
  brief attempt to define his method: "Deconstruction," Derrida
  says, "if there is such a thing as deconstruction -- and I
  wouldn't say there is just one deconstruction -- is something
  heterogeneous, complex. Deconstructions are ways of accounting
  for the main assumptions common to the culture, common to what we
  call Western culture.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Again, I
  don't think there is one Western culture," he quickly adds. "It's
  plural."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It's not
  easy even to apply a designation as simple as "philosopher" to
  Derrida, though he was educated in philosophy and is, at the
  moment, fingering the traditional token of a philosopher: a pipe.
  "I never thought I had something to say philosophically," he
  tells me. The word philosopher sometimes gets relegated to
  quotation marks in his writings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Derrida is
  also suspicious of the standard biographical accounts we append
  to the work of our writers. In fact, deconstruction (singular or
  plural) is known for the extent to which it turns attention to
  "texts" -- the actual words on paper -- and away from such
  distractions as the lives of the authors of those texts. One of
  Derrida's best known and most controversial pronouncements was,
  "There is nothing outside the text." And for a time it looked as
  though Derrida wanted nothing to appear in print about himself
  outside the actual texts he and his interpreters had written. For
  17 years, from 1962 to 1979, he would not even allow himself to
  be photographed for publication.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Consequently, Derrida wears, along with his stylish suits, a
  certain air of mystery. While there are a couple dozen books in
  English that feature Jacques Derrida's name in their titles or
  subtitles, it is almost impossible to find such basic
  biographical information as the fact that he is married
  (Derrida's wife of 33 years, Margaret, is a psychoanalyst), or
  that he has two sons, now in their 20s (one of whom has embarked
  on a career in philosophy).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Derrida is
  aware of his elusiveness. His fascination with words extends to
  their sound, and in the name "Derrida" (pronounced Dare-ee-DA) he
  says he hears the sounds "derriere le rideau" -- behind the
  curtain. Rather than attempt to yank the curtain back, I was
  prepared to tiptoe around the personal questions, but that proved
  unnecessary. Derrida is surprisingly forthright.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Why did
  you refuse to allow yourself to be photographed?"</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"My
  surface motivation was political," Derrida says, softly. "I
  thought that the things I was writing were not compatible with
  this silly image of the writer in his office with his books. If
  there was a deep motivation, it had to do with my relationship
  with my face, my body."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Why then
  this change in policy?"</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"It's a
  kind of resignation. I gave up this image of the
  non-image."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">JACQUES
  DERRIDA WAS BORN, in 1930,
  into-a-petit-bourgeois-Jewish-family-which-was-assimilated-into-French-life-in-
  Algeria-but. . . . (The word but appears often in his story.) But
  not entirely assimilated. "There were insults," he recalls, "and
  all the usual manifestations of anti-Semitism." Jacques was the
  middle child ("this explains everything in my life," he quips),
  always fighting with his older brother, never fighting with his
  younger sister. His father was a salesman; his brother became a
  pharmacist. Jacques, who would grow up to be the only
  intellectual in his immediate family, was a "very good pupil"
  until the age of 12. "Then things got complicated."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In 1942, a
  less common form of anti-Semitism reached Algeria. On the first
  day of school, the principal called Jacques into his office and
  said, "You're going to go back home. Your parents will
  explain."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">While the
  young Derrida was feeling some small part of the horror of
  Nazism, Paul de Man, the late Yale literature professor who
  became Derrida's friend and most influential supporter, was
  writing literary articles, one of which seems clearly
  anti-Semitic for a collaborationist newspaper in Nazi-occupied
  Belgium.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Inspired
  in part by this terrible news, which was revealed four years
  after De Man's death, Derrida recently has been questioning
  (i.e., reading "texts" on) the concept of friendship -- among the
  larger stones in the foundation of our civilization. Derrida,
  characteristically, is investigating the concept's cracks, its
  contradictions: the extent to which friendship is necessary but
  impossible, loving but not too loving, caring but competitive, a
  form of union but, as are all our relations with others, also a
  form of separation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">For
  Derrida, many of these contradictions are embodied in the
  statement, "Oh my friends, there is no friend." For years, each
  of Derrida's lectures has begun with this enigmatic -- Derrida
  would say "undecidable" -- quotation attributed to Aristotle but
  not actually found anywhere in Aristotle's writings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  problem of friendship was an important theme in Derrida's early
  life, too. His childhood friends at the lycee in Algeria were put
  to the test after their Jewish playmate was expelled. They
  failed. "It was a very, very painful situation," he admits,
  "something which probably left deep scars."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Jewish
  community in Algeria reacted by organizing its own school. "But I
  didn't like it," Derrida says. In his work, Derrida has
  emphasized the importance of that which does not quite belong:
  the marginal. He finds many of the ambiguities, loose ends and
  contradictions for which he is searching buried in the margins of
  writings -- in the footnotes, parentheses and prefaces other
  readers overlook. And he sees himself as having lived on the
  margins -- not quite French, not quite Algerian and also not
  simply Jewish.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It took
  four months for the Free French government to repeal the "racial
  laws" in Algeria, but eventually Derrida was allowed back in the
  lycee. He returned, he says, as a "very irregular pupil -- very
  good in some disciplines, not so good in others." Good enough in
  philosophy and literature, however, to move to Paris at the age
  of 19 to prepare himself for the Ecole Normale Superieure,
  France's most prestigious college (where Jean-Paul Sartre met
  Simone de Beauvoir). And Derrida -- a boy not just from the
  provinces but from way beyond the provinces -- went on to secure
  a reputation among Parisian intellectuals that could begin to be
  compared to Sartre's. But. . . .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But
  Derrida continued to view himself as something of an outsider:
  "There is this distance, a distance because I was Jewish" -- a
  word he pronounces quietly -- "because I wasn't totally French."
  Although he published widely -- three books in 1967 alone -- and
  gained notoriety, as a philosopher can only in France, his fame
  was as a rebel, someone who challenged the dominant culture.
  (Politically, Derrida inhabits the left margin.) And, although he
  soon was teaching at the Ecole Normale, Derrida continued to see
  himself as removed from the academic establishment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"In the
  academy there are two images of me," Derrida suggests. "One is of
  a professor with authority, given honorary degrees, legitimized
  in so many ways. But the other is of a man who doesn't belong to
  the university, who is just destroying the norms, who is not an
  authentic scholar. These images constantly conflict with each
  other, and I'm in the middle, just traveling between the two.
  Sometimes I naively ask myself, 'Where am I?' "</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">JACQUES
  DERRIDA'S IDEAS first established a beachhead in America in 1966
  at a conference on structuralism at Johns Hopkins University.
  Structuralism is the belief, then all the rage among Parisian
  intellectuals, that "structures" -- like the rules and
  relationships that make words into a language -- underlie all
  forms of "communication," from tribal myths to French fashions.
  The American literary scholars gathered at that conference had
  been delighting themselves with their own perspicacity when
  Derrida, the youngest of the Frenchmen invited to perform for
  them, took the stage and announced, in effect, that the
  structuralism the au courant were so proud of having adopted was
  dead -- hopelessly entangled with the same unsupported beliefs in
  ultimate meanings and final answers that permeate all of Western
  thought. That caused some flutters beneath the
  cardigans.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And the
  impression that an original and important new thinker had been
  discovered was furthered when Derrida's writings started drifting
  across the Atlantic and being translated. They were, to say the
  least, unconventional: A sentence might begin on page 319 and not
  end until page 322; a single footnote might run the length of an
  article; two separate narrations might share the pages of a
  book.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Still, it
  was Derrida's reading, not his writing, that won most of the
  converts. He gave literature professors a special gift: a chance
  to confront -- not as mere second-rate philosophers, not as mere
  interpreters of novelists, but as full-fledged explorers in their
  own right -- the most profound paradoxes of Western thought
  (which helps explain why he has been accepted in American
  literature, not philosophy, departments). If they really read, if
  they stared intently enough at the metaphors, literature
  professors, from the comfort of their own easy chairs, could
  reveal the hollowness of the basic assumptions that lie behind
  all our writings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Language
  is an endlessly complex and unwieldy medium, Derrida argued, and
  writers are never entirely in control of their words. When Plato,
  the father of Western thought, is trying to explain, for example,
  why speech is a dramatically more effective way to communicate
  than writing, he ends up with this justification: Speech "is
  written in the soul of the listener." The metaphor and the
  argument conflict. Ernest Hemingway, arguing that bullfighting is
  "a tragedy, not a sport," continually explains bullfighting with
  analogies drawn from American sports. Again, the metaphors --
  like Freudian slips -- seemingly unconsciously subvert the
  argument.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Derrida
  was trying to show that most of the distinctions we attempt to
  draw can in some ultimate sense be thrown into question: Speech
  is not closer to our souls than writing; Hemingway's bullfighting
  is not of a different order than mere sports; sex (to choose
  another of his examples) is not purer than masturbation.
  Male/female, human/animal, good/evil -- if we read carefully
  enough, suspiciously enough, the value-laden comparisons upon
  which we base our ethical, aesthetic and political behavior can
  be, to use the lingo, "disturbed."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Derrida's
  acolytes were convinced that he had presented them with new eyes,
  new ways of seeing the tangles and dissonances of what was
  rapidly becoming the postmodern world. His opponents, whose
  number was becoming legion, saw fog banks, intentional obscurity
  and a cynicism that threatened to undercut all accepted notions
  of what is good, beautiful and politically important.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"OH MY
  FRIENDS, THERE IS NO friend. . . ." Derrida, a short man with a
  square face, strong nose and thick eyebrows, sits in front of an
  overcrowded class at UC Irvine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">While they
  still attract a throng of intellectual heavyweights, Derrida's
  lectures are no longer so clearly the place to be for academe's
  trailblazers. Deconstruction has lost a little of its newness and
  glamour. In fact, some trendsetters in the universities already
  have a new theory with which to perplex their students: the "new
  historicism," which reasserts (in an unexpected, provocative kind
  of way, of course) the importance of historical circumstances --
  circumstances outside the "text" -- on works of
  literature.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The fact
  that the cognoscenti are losing some of their excitement,
  however, is often a sign that a fashion is establishing itself
  with a larger public, and in a sense this is happening with
  deconstruction. Derrida himself -- with his increasing
  willingness to step out from behind his texts -- has appeared in
  a movie, "Ghost Dance," and even inspired a rock song by the
  English group Scritti Politti: "I'm in love with Jacques
  Derrida/Read a page and I know what I need ta/Take apart/My
  baby's heart. . . ." (Derrida had lunch with band leader Green
  and described him as "a very intelligent young man, really knows
  his Wittgenstein.")</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Deconstructivist architects acknowledge Derrida as an
  inspiration for their work: uncentered, marginal, committed to
  mocking expectations -- gardens without benches and trees. And
  Derrida's name has begun showing up in non-academic publications
  and broadcasts -- as the scourge of the author, as the epitome of
  the incomprehensible intellectual, as the postmodern era's "post
  man" and, most recently, as a patron saint of that controversial
  "multiculturalism" (though those Derrida favors with his
  deconstructions are almost exclusively white, male, European
  authors: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Husserl, Freud, Mallarme,
  Genet).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In France,
  where deconstruction fell in and out of fashion about half a
  decade earlier than it did here, Derrida remains an important
  force, a public figure who has involved himself in such political
  causes as the struggle against apartheid in South Africa and in
  favor of freedom of expression in pre-1989 Czechoslovakia.
  (Derrida was jailed in Czechoslovakia in 1982 after meeting with
  some dissident writers.) He breaks the stereotype of the French
  leftist intellectual by living not in Paris but in a suburb,
  Ris-Orangis -- on the margins of Paris. He does not spend his
  evenings in Left Bank cafes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  United States, Derrida first began giving his dense, iconoclastic
  lectures and seminars as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins,
  then at Yale, where in the late '70s and early '80s he played the
  role of guru to some members of the influential "Yale School" of
  literary criticism, which included De Man, Harold Bloom, Geoffrey
  Hartman and J. Hillis Miller.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">DERRIDA'S
  SQUARE HANDS are folded in front of him. A pair of clear-framed
  half-glasses rests on his nose. He is reading, or rather
  translating, from his French notes, notes that themselves are
  spotted with citations in German and Greek. Derrida began
  lecturing in English for the first time at Irvine, but English
  words still escape from his mouth slowly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">After 30
  minutes, we reach what the professor says will be his starting
  point. After 43 minutes he announces, "That's where we are
  beginning today." Not that he could be accused of wasting time.
  Like most of those rare individuals endowed with gravity, Derrida
  seems to circle but not drift. Fifty minutes into the lecture,
  Derrida's investigation of some sentence from a great philosopher
  becomes particularly obtuse, and his audience allows itself a
  collective fidget -- its first and last.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"One
  often, if not always, speaks too fast, too early," Derrida is
  explaining. "One often speaks without seeing, without knowing,
  without meaning what one says." One often speaks without . . .
  meaning what one says? You can see why Derrida drives those
  accustomed to more cautious statements batty. Not only is he
  arguing that we contradict ourselves, occasionally switching
  positions in mid-thought -- "Oh my friends, there is no friend"
  -- but also that it is impossible for us to communicate with
  friends, or even with ourselves, with perfect clarity, that it is
  impossible to achieve some sort of ultimate, unambiguous
  understanding.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  problem, Derrida contends, is that meaning is always dependent on
  context. " 'There is nothing outside the text,' " he explains in
  a recent book, "means there is nothing outside context." And
  since the context in which words might be read or heard can
  always shift, meanings are impossible to completely pin down --
  and the distinctions we base on them ultimately rest on
  sand.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Remember
  that one magic moment -- perhaps you were in a garden, on a
  bench, under a tree -- when the meaning of existence suddenly
  came into focus? Well, Derrida has bad news, especially for those
  who have devoted their lives to the truth of such magnificent,
  all-encompassing visions: The world, he maintains, can be viewed
  from a limitless number of different perspectives. There is no
  one true answer. Aha! But doesn't deconstruction itself pretend
  to be such an answer? No, says Derrida, who presents
  deconstruction not as a conclusive theory but as a method for
  uncovering the contradictions at the heart of attempts to
  formulate such conclusive theories.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">For those
  political or intellectual conservatives who insist on the
  validity of simple truths, straightforward values and a single
  cultural tradition, Derrida is indeed the enemy. He sees instead
  a world that is complex, contradictory and plural. Derrida is no
  friend to doctrinaire leftists either. His views allow too much
  room for doubt. Even those of us who are simply trying to hang
  our beliefs on one or two solid principles will find Derrida's
  work troubling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Nevertheless, as he and his friends emphasize and
  re-emphasize, Derrida is not a nihilist. The fact that, in
  Derrida's view, there is no one meaning does not mean that there
  is no meaning at all. We can, of course, determine whether
  statements are true or false within the specified contexts of,
  say, science or magazine profiles. And this does not mean, as
  Derrida notes in this lecture, that we are freed of
  responsibility to try as hard as we can to say what we think we
  mean. It does mean that we can never know all there is to know
  about a sentence attributed to Aristotle, about our existence,
  about what is good, even about the words we are saying -- all of
  which will always remain open to interpretation and
  reinterpretation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is no
  coincidence that deconstruction has arrived as this
  self-conscious century totters, coughing and wheezing, into its
  last years. One of the last great attempts to impose a single
  perspective upon human societies has crumbled before our eyes in
  Eastern Europe. Our "great war," the Cold War, was fought with
  interpretations of weapons, not weapons. Our businesses sell by
  placing their products in finely worked contexts. Our politicians
  triumph by manipulating the interpretation of the events in which
  they participate. Our governments are run as much by "spin
  doctors" as by policy makers. Derrida might be dubbed a "spin
  scholar."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"What
  marks Derrida's work," Tom Keenan of Princeton explains, "is this
  incredibly serious thinking of the idea that communication is not
  something transparent" -- that meaning does not simply shine
  through, that messages arrive bearing a variety of spins, that
  there is no one correct interpretation. This is an idea that has
  marked the work of other 20th-Century thinkers -- from Marshall
  McLuhan to Roland Barthes to Republican media-strategist Roger
  Ailes. It is perhaps the idea of the century, and Derrida -- with
  his attempts to think the limits of our ability to communicate,
  even with ourselves, his attempts to think the limits of thought
  -- may be following it to its most extreme, most disturbing,
  conclusions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">One often

  DINING AT A RESTAURANT called Hemingway's (his choice) -- a warm
  and dimly lighted place, since closed, near Newport Beach -- when
  Derrida says, with unexpected wistfulness, that he dreams of
  writing something naive, something straightforward, something --
  of all things -- simple.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Derrida
  is able to surprise you even when you think you know his
  thoughts," notes Jonathan Culler, whose book "On Deconstruction"
  provides one of the clearest introductions to Derrida's
  work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Derrida
  write simply? It is pretty to think it possible, but this is the
  thinker who seems always ready to strike off in a disconcerting
  new direction. (Derrida's ongoing seminar on friendship, for
  example, has been metamorphosing of late into an investigation of
  "the rhetoric of cannibalism" -- the ultimate attempt to become
  one with a friend.) This is the thinker who seems always eager to
  substitute a new ramification for a mere restatement, who refuses
  to settle for the more straightforward forms of prose, who has
  earned a reputation for being perhaps the most complex writer of
  our time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And the
  density, the complexity of Derrida's writing is no mere accident.
  It seems central to his thought -- to his circling, suspicious
  way of responding. (Indeed, Derrida has been attacked recently
  for his inability to offer a simple condemnation of De Man's
  wartime writings.) Derrida is the prophet of complexity -- the
  person who continually takes responsibility for noting the
  difficulties, the inescapable contradictions; the person who has
  finally accepted the impossibility of simplicity. "The world is
  complex," he tells me, "and I'm afraid -- or I hope -- it will
  remain so."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Nevertheless, this dream -- the simple book (not text) that
  rests unborn within him -- will come up again and again in our
  conversations. It would be a novel, perhaps. And in place of the
  great philosophers whose work he has so often deconstructed, the
  book's subject would be: a 12-year-old boy in Algeria, French but
  not French, Jewish but not Jewish, with friends but no friends; a
  19-year-old boy in Paris struggling to cross the
  "psychological/sociological borders" into and out of the world of
  Parisian intellectuals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I have
  the deep feeling of not having written what I would like to write
  and what I should have written," Derrida says, adding that in a
  sense he views all that he has written -- and Derrida has been
  remarkably prolific -- as a "preliminary exercise" for "the
  one-and-only project," which he suspects he will never write. "I
  know it's not possible to write in an absolutely naive fashion,
  but that's my dream."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Which may
  be where we stand after deconstruction: Derrida has been
  demonstrating the extent to which our dreams -- of naivete and
  simplicity, of perfect friendship, of indisputable meaning, of
  God, for that matter -- are impossible. But he also knows that we
  remain incapable of not dreaming.</font></p>
