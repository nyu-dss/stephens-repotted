  <p><font size="+1">Mitchell Stephens is here to tell us what, in
  our vanity and ignorance, we too often forget: that there is
  nothing, or at least precious little, new under the sun. In his
  thorough, scrupulous and witty history of news, Stephens amply
  demonstrates that man's fascination with news and his
  determination to disseminate it are no offspring of this age of
  technology, but are as old as man himself; in subtitling his
  history "From the Drum to the Satellite," Stephens means for us
  to understand that the two means of transmission have far more in
  common that we might at first think possible.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This is "an interpretive rather than an
  exhaustive history," one more concerned with "the nature of
  journalism" than with the many particulars of its development.
  Defining news as "new information about a subject of some public
  interest that is shared with some portion of the public,"
  Stephens goes on to examine the manifold forms this information
  takes and the equally manifold ways in which over the years it
  has fascinated all people in all societies.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The first thing to be said of Stephens is that
  he is neither a snob nor a purist. Persons looking for a defense
  of journalistic sobriety and a condemnation of sensationalism
  will not find it here. Stephens believes, and he is right, that
  in giving full play to what is startling and unusual and even
  grotesque and/or offensive, the press merely gives people what
  they want -- that the human appetite for sensation is natural and
  that "without gossip, without crime -- without the humanizing and
  stimulating touch of occasional inanities and outrages -- the
  news would lose much of its vitality."</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Stephens is a realist. He knows that "the news
  is not about life but about ... those dramatic moments when the
  spell of daily reality is broken by the death of a dictator, a
  defection or a drowning," and that this has been true for as long
  as people have asked the question, "What's new?" Whether the news
  is delivered by the oral systems of ancient societies or the
  television programs of our own, its essence is the
  same:</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">"When we choose to enter the world of breaking
  news, we enter a fun house. Abnormalities loom large in
  journalism's bent mirrors; perspectives are distorted; horrors
  materialize out of nowhere; everywhere we turn there is blood and
  danger. If there is a logic to the collection of intense moments
  that journalists package, it is a logic of discontinuity -- a
  carnival logic of freaks and catastrophes, a logic beyond the
  reach of the conventional sentiments with which most daily
  journalism must make do. Much of the time journalists, like
  circus announcers, are reduced to barking and adding admonitions:
  'Marvelous!' 'Prodigious!' 'Frightful!' 'Lamentable!' 'Horrible!'
  "</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This is entirely true, but in emphasizing it I
  do not mean to minimize the more serious aspects of Stephens'
  analysis. Among these are a persuasive argument that "the
  circulation of news ... in the long run strengthens a society" by
  emphasizing the commonality of interests and experiences its
  inhabitants share; a discussion of how the coming of literacy to
  Roman society introduced the elements of dispassion and analysis
  into the news; a reminder that journalistic institutions are
  inherently conservative, inasmuch as they depend for their
  survival on the patronage of any society's predominant forces;
  and a forthright but uncondescending acknowledgment that "the
  journalist's tendency toward superficiality" comes, as they say,
  with the territory.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">These and other themes Stephens explores
  within the framework of a deft tour through the history of news.
  From oral news systems to handwritten bulletins to the Gutenberg
  press to news ballads to newspapers to radio and television, he
  doesn't miss a beat. Though he is himself a professor of
  journalism (at New York University) he has written not an
  inside-baseball book but one for the general reader; he has given
  the news and those who disseminate it a degree of legitimacy
  previously unsuspected by or of them, and he makes a powerful
  case for treating "the news" as seriously as any other aspect of
  common human interest and endeavor. "A History of News" is in all
  respects first-rate, and original, work.</font></p>
