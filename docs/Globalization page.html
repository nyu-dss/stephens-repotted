  "+1">BODY:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  mountains above Sarajevo last spring, a Serbian brigade was
  firing down on enemy positions. During a lull in the shelling, a
  Serbian soldier spotted an American reporter. Lowering his rifle,
  he drew the American aside and asked, "How are the Chicago Bulls
  doing in the NBA playoffs?" * Yes, old ethnic, religious and
  tribal antagonisms have flared up with horrifying violence in the
  years following the collapse of Soviet Communism. But if we want
  to figure out which way the world is headed, that Serbian
  soldier's interest in Michael Jordan may in the end prove more
  significant than his hatred of the Muslims and Croats. For there
  is evidence that no matter how much they kick and scream, the
  humans who inhabit this planet are inexorably being pulled
  together. * It is not just that National Basketball Assn. games
  are now televised in more than 100 different countries or that
  you can be listening to a Flemish radio station in Belgium and
  suddenly hear Cousin Brucie's "Cruisin' America" oldies show,
  exactly as it was broadcast on KCBS-FM in Los Angeles. It is not
  just that Paris today has about 70 Japanese restaurants, or that
  there are five Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in Beijing, or that
  a small cafe on the road from Ceske Budejovice to Tabor in the
  Czech Republic offers a couple of Mexican specialties. It is not
  just that Toyota now makes cars in Portugal, Ecuador, Kenya and
  Kentucky and sells them in 151 countries or that you can quench
  your thirst with a Coke in 185 countries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">(The
  United Nations only has 178 members.) * No, to understand the
  direction in which we are going, we also have to examine the
  consequences of these dramatic developments: the growing sameness
  of products made in Japan, Portugal, Ecuador, Kenya and Kentucky;
  the decline of indigenous and unique athletic, musical, culinary
  and even linguistic traditions; the fading differences between
  the cultures of the United States, Belgium and China. We have to
  acknowledge that it is becoming increasingly difficult to
  determine what country we are in from our surroundings. "Almost
  all Third World countries now have at least one huge city that
  has at least one quarter that feels like huge cities everywhere,"
  notes Will Baker, a UC Davis English professor who circled the
  world in 1989 in search of one of the prime manifestations of
  this phenomenon: "the global teen-ager."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Writes
  anthropologist Clifford Geertz: "We may be faced with a world in
  which there simply aren't any more headhunters, matrilinealists
  or people who predict the weather from the entrails of a pig."
  Cultural "variety," Geertz suggests, may be "rapidly softening
  into a paler, and narrower, spectrum."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">To
  understand what is happening to us, we have to realize that the
  special customs and interests that once distinguished that
  Serbian soldier from the Muslims and Croats he has been taught to
  hate, even those that distinguish him from basketball fans in
  Chicago, are disappearing. The people of the world are becoming
  more alike, and that process has large implications -- some
  promising, some frightening -- for our future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">IN
  YUGOSLAVIA IN THE 1950s, MANY OF THE MEN WERE STILL GARBED IN
  THEIR traditional costumes: The Serbs wore sheepskin caps and
  sandals with leather straps wound around their legs. Croats
  sported felt hats with narrow brims and knee boots. In Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, Muslim men often wore a fez and a large cummerbund.
  All of Europe was once decorated with such exotic headgear,
  footwear and clothing. Today, however, you can drive for
  thousands of miles across the continent and, except for the long
  skirt and scarf still worn by many Eastern European women, see no
  form of dress that would be out of place in Kansas. The old
  costumes -- the lederhosen, the kilts, even the berets -- are
  reserved for postcards, festivals and the "It's a Small World"
  ride at the new Euro Disneyland.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Muslim
  children who have been ducking the mortar and rifle fire in
  Sarajevo dress in jeans, T-shirts and sneakers. So do the
  children of the Serbs who are doing the firing. So do the
  children of the Croats. Indeed, that is the uniform, give or take
  a baseball cap, now worn by a large percentage of the world's
  young people. If their parents are under the age of 45, they,
  too, probably wear some variation of this basic
  outfit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">No longer
  can visitors to a Disneyland or to Fifth Avenue or the Champs
  Elysees play the guess-what-country-those-people-are-from game.
  Levi's jeans are now for sale in more than 70 different nations.
  In Japan alone, the NBA sells T-shirts and baseball caps at 250
  stores. UCLA anthropologist Nadine Peacock once spotted a Harvard
  football jersey on a tribesman in the middle of a rain forest in
  Zaire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"The
  global material culture is encroaching everywhere," observes
  another UCLA anthropology professor, Nancy Levine. It is a small
  world, an increasingly small world, after all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">U.S.
  movies are a prime example. "I can't think of any country right
  now, with the possible exception of India, where the American
  film is not No. 1 or 2 at the box office," says Jack Valenti, the
  president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America. In Italy and
  Germany recently, 85% of the yearly box-office gross was earned
  by dubbed or subtitled versions of American movies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The world
  is listening to the same music, too. "I would doubt that there is
  any country on the face of the Earth where there aren't some
  people who know who Madonna is," suggests Tom Freston, the
  chairman and CEO of MTV Networks, which now broadcasts music
  videos by Madonna and other international rock stars in 72
  countries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Wherever
  her recordings are sold, Madonna sings, between moans, in
  English. All the world's top rock stars do. If a Swedish group
  wants to sell in France, that's the language in which it must
  write the lyrics -- the language that also appears on most of the
  world's T-shirts and caps, the language of international science,
  the one used by the world's air-traffic controllers. English is
  now an official language in 63 countries; it is becoming the
  unofficial second language in many of the rest. The inhabitants
  of the Tower of Babel may finally have found a tongue in which
  they will all eventually be able to communicate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Television
  programs, unlike rock songs, can be dubbed into the local
  language; they can even be remade with local performers, as, for
  example, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Married With Children" often
  are. But the shows remain the same around the world. In
  Bangladesh, for example, "MacGyver," "Little House on the
  Prairie" and "Hawaii Five-O" are all currently big hits. And four
  of the five top non-news shows in South Africa are American
  series: "Who's the Boss?," "P.S. I Luv U," "Growing Pains" and
  "Alf."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  currents pouring into this new international mix are not
  exclusively American. Anthropologist Mitzi Goheen reports, for
  example, that both "Matlock" and "Sesame Street" (watched mostly
  by adults) are popular on Cameroon's new television system, but
  so are some German game shows and a Brazilian soap opera. Foreign
  programming has even been making inroads in the United States.
  One American cable service, the Learning Channel, is planning to
  purchase 50% of its programming overseas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the
  end, where this new culture hails from is less significant than
  where it is spreading to -- just about everywhere. Some years
  ago, Peter Berger, the director of the Institute for the Study of
  Economic Culture at Boston University, was traveling through a
  remote part of Indonesia in an open jeep. Berger, it must be
  noted, shaves what little hair remains on his head. "We pulled
  into this village in central Java that looked very exotic," he
  recalls. "I thought I was really in the heart of the Third World.
  It seemed an untouched folk culture, but then suddenly some kids
  started running after the jeep pointing at me and yelling,
  'Kojak! Kojak!' "</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"There
  isn't any culture in the world today," says Frederic Wakeman, a
  UC Berkeley professor of Chinese history, "that is hermetic,
  sealed off by itself." It should therefore come as no surprise
  that we fellow "Kojak" and "Alf" watchers are also starting to
  think alike: about politics and economics, for example. Left- and
  right-wing dictatorships have both fallen out of fashion in
  recent decades. Democratic capitalism seems very much in vogue.
  Of course, the affection of autocrats for power should never be
  underestimated; large parts of the world -- China and Africa
  prominent among them -- have lagged in the democracy area. Still,
  for the moment at least, democratic ideas do seem to be spreading
  along with blue jeans and "Who's the Boss?"</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">More and
  more of the planet's residents are also beginning to think
  globally. We have global trade agreements (108 nations are now
  participating in the GATT talks), a World Court and the United
  Nations. We suffer from what is perceived as a global
  environmental crisis. The International Herald Tribune has just
  begun publishing a "world stock index," and our deep thinkers
  increasingly scratch their heads over the fate not just of a
  nation but of humankind. Sociologists, like Roland Robertson of
  the University of Pittsburgh, call this " globalization."
  Robertson has seen it in his life as well as in the literature:
  He was born in England with Scottish ancestors; his wife is an
  Irish-American; one of his sons is married to a Japanese-American
  woman, the second to a Guatemalan woman and the third is living
  with a Swedish woman of Latvian and Danish descent (all three
  young couples live -- where else? -- in California). In this
  ethnically tangled world, Robertson notes, people have been
  forced to look beyond their own nationalities and view their
  situations in "global terms."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The world
  is still ravaged by tribal wars of the sort that have broken out
  in the former Yugoslavia, but perhaps these wars are dying gasps,
  last attempts to hold onto ethnic identities in the face of these
  global homogenizing forces. For in various large and small ways,
  the world's human inhabitants are beginning to think as if they
  are, or at least might be, one.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">OF COURSE,
  IN A SENSE, WE ALWAYS WERE ONE, A SINGLE SPECIES. WE CAN
  INTERBREED. There have always been significant similarities in
  the way Homo sapiens eat, mate, pal around and communicate. But
  upon that basic biological unity, we have constructed, over the
  millennia, some radically different cultures: gatherers, farmers,
  cannibals, societies where women take multiple husbands, the
  French, etc.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Many
  peoples have greeted such differences with violence: Precedents
  for the bloodshed in Bosnia today are not hard to find. But most
  societies have been able to suspend their suspicion and hostility
  long enough to learn some things from each other -- important
  things. Europeans, for example, borrowed two crops from Native
  Americans, potatoes and corn, that went a long way toward solving
  Europe's food problems.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And the
  lessons we receive from other cultures go beyond the immediately
  practical. "Looking at people who have different views of things,
  different attitudes toward the world, gets you to question your
  own views," explains Geertz, who is based at the Institute for
  Advanced Study in Princeton. "It expands your mind." The question
  is whether the opportunities for such an education are declining.
  Quantifying the strength and resilience of local cultures may be
  beyond the current capabilities of the social sciences. But the
  anecdotal evidence that local traditions and practices have begun
  to succumb to the global culture is plentiful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Anthropologist Levine has studied a group of people on the
  Tibetan border in Nepal among whom women often do, in fact, have
  multiple husbands, usually brothers. These people used to wear
  long, homemade boots with buffalo-hide soles and embroidered wool
  tops. Now, Levine reports, many take to the mountain trails in
  Nikes. The men used to bunch their hair in a knot on the tops of
  their heads. Now most have what the anthropologist describes as
  "a sort of moderate Western haircut, one that would look normal
  on the streets of Los Angeles." And as for their uncommon form of
  marriage: "In the villages themselves, it doesn't seem to be
  changing," Levine explains. "But with improved communication and
  air travel, people are moving to Katmandu. Once they get there,
  they seem to move toward monogamy."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Anyone in
  this half-century who has returned to some distant place after a
  long interval knows the extent to which the local and distinct
  are being replaced -- or "spoiled" -- by the international and
  familiar. When Wakeman lived in Taiwan in the 1960s, for example,
  shopping in his neighborhood was done at open-air markets, and
  the bakeries sold cakes topped with lard. He returned in 1988 to
  find the neighborhood dotted with 7-Eleven stores and pizza
  parlors. "I'd heard about the changes," the China scholar
  explains, "but they were just overwhelming."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Goheen, an
  anthropology professor at Amherst, recalls a graduate student
  from Kenya who was relieved, upon arriving in the United States,
  to discover that he could get Kentucky Fried Chicken here,
  too.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THIS
  PROCESS OF CULTURAL MIXING, OR HOMOGENIZATION, DID NOT START with
  Coca-Cola or Charlie Chaplin. Europeans had already "spoiled"
  countless local traditions while colonizing the Americas, Africa,
  Australia and parts of Asia; before that had come the spread of
  world religions like Christianity and Islam, at the expense of
  the old pagan practices, and before that, the far-flung empires
  of Rome, China and Alexander had trampled, with varying degrees
  of brutality, the numerous cultures that got in their
  way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  mixing, however, has grown significantly more energetic in our
  century for three reasons: First, means have been devised that
  permit cultures to be trampled from a distance. In the years
  after the end of World War I, eyes and ears from Vancouver to
  Berlin to New Delhi began to turn from local entertainments and
  to fix themselves on Hollywood movies and Tin Pan Alley songs.
  Such innovations as television, electric guitars, stereo,
  satellites, computers, Walkmen, VCRs and CDs have brought more
  and more people under the spell. Particularly young people: "Kids
  in Australia, Hong Kong and Sweden today might have more in
  common with each other than with their parents," says MTV's
  Freston.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Second,
  eased trade barriers, easier travel and instant communication
  have allowed those most dedicated cultural emissaries, business
  people, to hawk identical products to different peoples around
  the world. Coke was first sold overseas in the year 1900. When
  Baker, in his report on the "global teen-ager" for the magazine
  Whole Earth Review, asked 169 teen-agers in 12 countries on five
  continents to identify the Coca-Cola logo, only six could
  not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Third, the
  world's populations, as they grow more mobile, have been
  reshuffling themselves. "A hell of a lot of people aren't where
  they're supposed to be these days," Geertz declares. "Caribbeans
  are in London, Tamils in Holland, Turks in Germany, and everybody
  is in New York and Los Angeles." The United States, the
  traditional melting pot, currently has more foreign-born
  residents -- 19.7 million -- than ever before. But the wealthier
  parts of the Old World, too, have been flooded with immigrants.
  There are more than 1 million non-Japanese currently living in
  Japan, 4 million foreign-born individuals in France and more than
  7 million foreign "guest workers" and refugees in Germany (That's
  8% of the country's population). The world itself, despite recent
  outbreaks of resentment and even violence, seems to be turning
  into one vast melting pot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Have these
  three homogenizing forces -- global media, multinational business
  and immigration -- led to an actual decline in the number of
  different cultures in the world? Cultures are not easy to define,
  let alone count. But Michael Krauss, a professor of linguistics
  at the University of Alaska, has done the next best thing:
  attempted to measure the decline of the world's languages. "In
  many ways, language is the essence of culture," he explains.
  Krauss, the director of the Alaska Native Language Center,
  reports that 6,000 languages, give or take 10%, are still being
  spoken today. But somewhere between 20% and 50% of those
  languages are no longer being spoken by children. "That doesn't
  mean they're endangered," Krauss explains. "It means they're
  doomed."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Many more
  are at risk. Krauss estimates that only about 600 languages are
  "relatively safe," either because they are currently spoken by at
  least 100,000 people or because they are protected by a
  government. The rest are falling victim to bulldozers, which are
  destroying the jungles that used to shelter them, to intolerant
  national governments and to the global forces of homogenization
  -- as people are "catapulted," in Wakeman's words, "from the
  oxcart to a satellite dish that is picking up Ted
  Turner."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Krauss
  predicts that "at the rate things are going, the coming century
  will see the extinction or doom of 90% of the world's linguistic
  diversity. It is doubtful whether a culture can survive without a
  language." So his figures force us to consider what the cost
  would be of losing 90% of the world's cultures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Maybe less
  cultural difference would mean less violence. That's the good
  news. This might be a tough idea to sell in Sarajevo at the
  moment, but when and if they can look coolly at each other,
  Russians and Americans, Palestinians and Israelis, even Serbs and
  Croats (who already speak the same language), should be able to
  see that there is less and less at which they might turn up their
  noses. Both Palestinians and Israelis now spend Sunday evenings
  sprawled on a couch watching "L.A. Law" -- in English with Hebrew
  and Arabic subtitles. Demonizing someone who is watching the same
  shows, listening to the same music and wearing the same sneakers
  as you becomes more difficult (though obviously, as the Irish and
  others have proved, not impossible).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The bad
  news is that learning something new from that person is also more
  difficult. In other words, we might lose, in a period of only
  about 100 years, the educational opportunities represented by 90%
  of the world's cultures. "These are not societies that tried to
  be like us and flunked the test," notes Harvard anthropology
  professor David Maybury-Lewis. "They have different moralities
  than we do, different ideas about the way people should relate to
  others, certainly different ideas about the way people should
  relate to the environment. In our day-to-day lives, we jog along
  thinking that things are the way they are because this is the way
  they have to be. It is important for us to understand the
  enormous variety of other ways humans can live their
  lives."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Jason Clay
  is one of the directors of Cultural Survival, the organization
  Maybury-Lewis set up to help protect indigenous peoples (from
  direct threats like bulldozers and bullets, not indirect threats
  like television). "It would take 100,000 years to re-create the
  knowledge these cultures have," Clay asserts. "Every time one of
  these cultures goes, that knowledge goes with it. It is like
  burning the Library of Congress."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In an
  essay in his book "Disturbing the Universe," the physicist
  Freeman Dyson shudders at the potential consequences of such
  losses: "It is likely that in the future our survival and our
  further development will depend in an equally crucial way on the
  maintenance of cultural and biological diversity," he writes.
  Dyson, who like Geertz is at the Institute for Advanced Study,
  admits to having "sort of a bad conscience" about being, as an
  English speaker, one of the conquering people. "We are seducing
  and trampling down other cultures all over the world," he says.
  "It is, in a way, monstrous."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">SOME
  DISMISS THIS NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. THEY ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT the
  world's individual cultures are losing all their energy and
  distinctness. "The second law of cultural thermodynamics doesn't
  appeal to me," Geertz says. "I just don't see that as I look
  around." What he sees instead is a world that may be growing
  short on cannibals but still seems rich in diversity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider,
  as an example, Topeka, Kan. Along with four Arby's and six Burger
  Kings, diners in Topeka now have their choice of Chinese,
  Italian, Mexican, French, Japanese, Greek, Vietnamese, Caribbean,
  Thai and German restaurants. On Wednesdays, they can buy food
  prepared by members of the Pottawatomie tribe of American
  Indians. You couldn't ask for much more culinary diversity.
  There's also lots of ethnic diversity in Topeka at the moment:
  One section of town, for instance, is known as "Little Russia,"
  and Topeka now has its own tortilla factory. In addition, thanks
  in part to those much maligned multinationals, you can buy an
  impressive variety of products there in the American heartland:
  German cars, Korean televisions, Colombian coffee, Scandinavian
  furniture, Japanese seaweed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Indeed, we
  victims of globalization, as Robertson of the University of
  Pittsburgh points out, seem to be growing more, not less,
  respectful of diversity. Hence, multiculturalism. Hence, those
  Saturday or Sunday schools in which children learn the language
  and traditions of their grandparents. Moreover, the compulsion to
  stand up for our paesanos, for our cultural kinsmen and
  kinswomen, remains a major force in the world: in South-Central
  Los Angeles, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in the Balkans.
  Ethnicity maintains its pull, "often to the vast detriment of
  everybody involved," notes Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole
  Earth Review. "It is clear," he concludes, "that this is powerful
  stuff." We may be teetering at the edge of a huge melting pot,
  but many of us seem to be struggling not to fall in. Might the
  forces of diversity, therefore, be strong enough to hold out
  against the forces of homogenization? Many anthropologists
  believe they are.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"If you
  live with people in very different cultural situations," explains
  Amherst's Goheen, who spent five years in Cameroon, "it becomes
  evident to you how powerful a culture is, because to them, you
  are a cultural fool. You inappropriately use the wrong hand to
  give things to people. You make incredible gaffes."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  anthropologists argue that, despite imported dolls (Barbie is
  sold in 80 countries) and even imported waters (Evian is sold in
  about 100), the world's cultures are tenaciously hanging on to
  their own idiosyncratic customs, to their individuality. "There
  is a stubbornness to these things," Geertz argues. "Japan is
  extremely modern, but it is also extremely Japanese."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Maybe.
  Maybe you can eat at McDonald's (now offering its "standard menu"
  in 62 countries), celebrate Christmas (as many now do in, for
  example, China and Taiwan), wear Levi's and Nikes, listen to
  Nirvana, pick up some English, root for Michael Jordan and still
  remain extremely something else. Maybe, as Brand argues, this
  pop-consumer-entertainment culture that we all are beginning to
  share will become everybody's "second culture," and "our first
  cultures will continue to hold out in resistance to
  it."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Maybe
  people will even invent new differences over which they might
  squabble and from which they might learn. International
  communities already seem to be forming, based not on geography
  but on interest -- in rap music, for example, or astronomy or
  scuba diving. Maybe the diversity they provide will be
  sufficient. "I don't see why differences have to be dramatic to
  be instructive," Geertz says. "I don't see that you have to have
  cannibals."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  arguments, however, seem to neglect an important factor: time.
  The old cultures, with their distinct languages, their complex
  traditions, their special ways of seeing the world, were formed
  over many millennia. They first came under all-out assault by the
  new global culture only in the last few decades; the countries of
  Eastern Europe are just now beginning to feel the full force of
  that assault. The fact that many cultures still retain a strong
  sense of their individuality, that Serbs still are put off by
  Croats, that the Japanese are still "extremely Japanese," is not
  all that surprising given the relative periods of time involved.
  They may not be that Japanese after another 50 or 100 years of
  pizza and the NBA. Over time, in other words, the endlessly
  seductive global "second culture" may become everybody's first
  culture.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Those new
  international communities of interest, which might be all we have
  left if the world becomes more homogenized, may not have enough
  time to develop challenging new perspectives of their own.
  Perhaps the most energetic such community in recent years was the
  rap culture developed by African-Americans in the inner cities.
  However, once it was clear that its creators were on to
  something, the record companies, the Hollywood producers and
  Paris designers quickly moved in. Newly hatched ideas were sucked
  into the larger culture long before they had a chance to grow and
  mature. Japanese culture developed over thousands of years. Rap
  got maybe a decade.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The global
  culture is, by nature, always seeking new diversions. It enjoyed
  reggae for some years; now it's delighted at the chance to wear
  oversize jeans and show its underpants. Everything eventually
  gets tossed into that constantly simmering
  Tex-Mex-Kentucky-Fried-Sweet-and-Sour-McSushi-Gyro stew. But if
  the old traditions are being watered down, and if the new are
  eaten while still young, that stew will lose its substance and
  its spice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Another
  equally disturbing image comes to mind: When you first begin
  stirring many different-colored paints in a can, you get some
  colors that clash, but you also get some beautiful rainbow
  patterns. Maybe that is the period we are in now. We are seeing
  renewed outbreaks of ethnic warfare, but we are also delighting
  in a swirl of exotic foods, foreign products and diverse
  neighbors. The question is: What will human culture look like
  after that paint can has been stirred a century or two
  longer?</font></p>
