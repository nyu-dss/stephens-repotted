  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Reporting would not seem to have required inventing. Humans,
  after all, have always been good at finding out what was going on
  around them. They have always known where to go, whom to talk to,
  to get the latest news.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Yet those
  who worked for seventeenth- and eighteenth-century newspapers
  were, with remarkably few exceptions, unprepared or unwilling to
  perform what we would see as the most basic journalistic task:
  pursuing a story. Instead they waited, mostly in their print
  shops, for news to come to them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The first
  issue of the first newspaper published in English (but printed in
  Amsterdam) in 1620 begins with an apology: "The new tydings out
  of Italie are not yet com." There is no evidence that those who
  produced such newspapers were prepared to seek out "tydings" on
  their own. Instead, their promises to their readers were often
  qualified with the phrase: "if the Post faile us not." If the
  winds were blowing the wrong way, if the roads were washed out,
  if the post did fail, then that week's newspaper likely would
  contain a spate of hastily composed essays. "No mail yesterday,"
  wrote the Orleans Gazette as late as 1805, "We hardly know what
  we shall fill our paper with that will have the appearance of
  news."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">What news
  there was often arrived by a roundabout route, as in this item
  from a New York newspaper in 1778: "The Hartford Post, tell us,
  That he saw a Gentleman in Springfield, who informed him that
  heï¿½saw a Letter from an Officer in Gen. Howe's Army to another in
  Gen. Burgoyne's giving him to understand, WAR was declared on the
  sides of France and Spain against the MIGHTY Kingdom of Britain."
  This not unimportant piece of news for the Americans, who were
  currently fighting Britain, had actually been lifted, as so much
  news was, from another paper - a month old Boston newspaper. And,
  as so much news at the time did, it had an additional weakness:
  it was untrue. Such was life without reporting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Nothing
  did more to change this than the attempt to cover the British
  Parliament in London in the late eighteenth century. And,
  therefore, nothing contributed as much to the development of the
  energetically, some might even say too energetically, reported
  upon world we live in today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Printers
  had suppressed their normal human newsgathering instinct in part
  because they hadn't the time to leave their shops: Churning out a
  few thousand copies of a sheet was a time consuming business.
  They also failed to go out in search of news in part because they
  didn't need to: In an entertainment-scarce world even those
  hastily composed essays would be enough to engage most readers.
  And they failed to compete for the latest local news in part
  because they weren't able to: Everyone would have heard about a
  local fire or crime well before the newspaper finally arrived.
  Best, therefore, to wait for the "new tydings out of Italie" or
  to rely upon "the Hartford Post."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But in
  London and other large European cities in the eighteenth century
  these factors began to change. Newspapers became big enough
  businesses to allow for staffs: someone to mind the presses,
  someone else to set about filling the paper. Competition picked
  up: If the Post-Boy had a story earlier than the Post-Man, if the
  Flying Post had more details than the Evening Post (all London
  newspapers in the early 1700s) then they might sell more copies.
  And these cities grew large enough so that a newspaper,
  particularly a daily newspaper, could compete with word of mouth
  on events that happened in town.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  biggest ongoing story in London was of course the Parliament. The
  British Parliament, like most such bodies, had been fairly
  successful in keeping its deliberations secret from nonmembers
  (particularly that most powerful of nonmembers, the monarch). But
  interest in parliamentary debates ran high, and by 1770 London
  newspapers were tentatively printing accounts of the debates
  under purposely ambiguous headings, such as "A Great Assembly."
  The House of Commons tried to crack down on these violations of
  its privacy. In the increasingly liberal British climate, it
  failed. No one was thrown in jail. A new age of more open
  politics began - in England at least. A new age of political
  journalism began. So did a new age of reporting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">By 1774 at
  least seven London newspapers were sending journalists to observe
  parliamentary debates. These journalists became perhaps the first
  group to regularly cover an important beat, the first press
  corps. They operated, however, under a significant handicap. No
  note taking was permitted in the gallery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  world's first press corps, therefore, had to sit through these
  debates - they might run as long as twelve hours - and then
  recreate them for their newspapers. Hence, the nickname of the
  most renowned of these first parliamentary reporters: William
  "Memory" Woodfall. How good a job of recreating the speeches did
  Woodfall and the others do? This comment by one member of
  Parliament on an account of a speech he had given is revealing:
  "Why, to be sure, there are in that report a few things which I
  did say, but many things which I am glad I did not say, and some
  things which I wish I could have said."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Competition produced innovation. One editor began to steal
  readers from Woodfall's paper by sending a series of young men up
  to the gallery in short shifts. Then, in 1783, journalists were
  allowed to take notes while watching Parliament. This changed the
  game. Knowledge of shorthand, rather than a prodigious memory,
  became the main qualification for the job. In fact, to say
  someone knew how "to report" in England or the United States at
  the end of the eighteenth century meant that they knew how to
  take shorthand. (John Dickens and, later, his son Charles were
  among those who would use shorthand to report on
  Parliament.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  "reporters" soon took their enterprise, if not always
  stenographic ability, to other corners of society. There were
  reporters at sensational London trials, a London reporter in
  Paris during the Revolution, reporters witnessing battles in the
  Napoleonic Wars and a reporter from the London Times in the
  middle of the radical rally that became a police massacre known
  as Peterloo in 1819.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">That human
  ability to find out what was going on had finally been combined
  with the great power of the printing press. The news, now often
  witnessed first hand, grew more accurate. Politicians, judges,
  soldiers were suddenly under observation. Injustices were
  exposed. The world would never again look the same.</font></p>
