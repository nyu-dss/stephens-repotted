  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The full
  technological potential of radio was made manifest on Christmas
  Eve 1906. Its potential as a form of mass communication did not
  become evident until much later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Radio had
  been invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895 as "wireless
  telegraphy" -- a means for sending Morse code through the air.
  But on Dec. 24, 1906, a few wireless operators on ships in the
  North Atlantic heard not the usual dots and dashes but a voice
  reading from St. Luke's Gospel. It was Reginald Fessenden, an
  American who had devised a means for radio waves to carry signals
  for a range of sound. "Wireless telephony" had
  arrived.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Soon,
  amateur radio operators in the United States and elsewhere were
  using this technology to chat with each other. After World War I,
  radio's future seemed to be in transmitting long-distance
  telephone calls, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
  made sure it rounded up the key patents.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Some radio
  buffs set themselves up as broadcasters, playing music or reading
  newspapers to anyone who tuned in. But, as the historian Daniel
  Czitrom wrote, "virtually no one in the scientific, amateur,
  military or corporate communities had expected broadcasting to
  become the main use of wireless technology."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Indeed,
  the word broadcasting, which meant scattering widely, had not yet
  been applied to radio.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Then, in
  the fall of 1920, a Westinghouse Electric executive, Harry P.
  Davis, had an epiphany. The attention that a Westinghouse
  engineer had attracted with his amateur transmissions from his
  garage in East Pittsburgh, Mr. Davis later wrote, "caused the
  thought to come to me that the efforts that were then being made
  to develop radio-telephony as a confidential means of
  communication were wrong, and that instead its field was really
  one of wide publicity." Mr. Davis realized, in other words, that
  radio transmissions could be heard by the masses.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">On Nov. 2,
  1920, at Mr. Davis's urging, Westinghouse introduced what is
  considered the first commercial radio station -- KDKA in
  Pittsburgh -- with a report on the Harding-Cox Presidential
  voting. By the end of 1922, 576 commercial radio stations were
  operating in the United States.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But a
  large question remained: How would these new stations make money?
  Mr. Davis's financial goal for KDKA was simply to help
  Westinghouse sell more radios, and in 1922 about 100,000 radio
  receivers were purchased in the United States. But that same
  year, AT&amp;T was already introducing a new way to profit by
  charging people who wanted to broadcast from AT&amp;T's
  transmitters a "toll" for access to the audience of its growing
  group of stations. The strategy rapidly evolved into the the
  advertiser-supported model of broadcasting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">By 1925,
  5.5 million radio sets were in use in the United States, and what
  was in Mr. Davis's words "the only means of instantaneous
  collective communication ever devised" had begun to capture its
  mass audience. The following year AT&amp;T -- recognizing that
  radio no longer seemed to have much to do with telephony -- sold
  its stations to the newly created National Broadcasting
  Company.</font></p>
