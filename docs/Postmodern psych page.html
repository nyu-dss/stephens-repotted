  BREED OF PSYCHOLOGISTS SAYS THERE'S NO ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
  'WHO AM I?' Postmodern Psychology</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">BYLINE:
  <font size="+2">By <a href="MS_Home.html">Mitchell
  Stephens</a></font>, Mitchell Stephens is a journalism professor
  at New York University and the author of A History of News. His
  last article for this magazine was The Death of
  Reading.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">PICK A
  LATE-20TH-CENTURY CITY, BETTER AN AMERICAN CITY, EVEN BETTER A
  CALIFORNIA city, and study one of the inhabitants. Note the range
  of people this individual is exposed to: the different ethnic
  backgrounds, the different lifestyles, the different beliefs.
  Then observe the variety of behaviors the subject exhibits: from
  vegetarianism to weightlifting, or from bungee jumping to helping
  the homeless. And note how often and how easily these behaviors
  change.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Now move
  in closer, close enough to hear the specimen's thoughts. A jumble
  of voices will become audible: some bold, some whiny; some
  mature, some immature; some naive, some cynical. You'll pick up
  echoes of parents, friends and talk-show hosts; rapper-like
  boasts and Woody Allen-like anxieties.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Keep
  listening and eventually you will hear a question. Perhaps it
  will arrive during a session with a therapist or a heart-to-heart
  with a friend, perhaps in some lonely moment late at night. (The
  older and the more self-satisfied the subject, the longer you may
  have to wait.) But at some point that person will wonder: "Who am
  I?" And if you have been paying attention, you will understand
  why no good answer comes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Who am
  I?" Snuggled up behind this question is a comfortable, mostly
  unnoticed assumption: that we each have a kernel of identity, a
  self. It is a supposition that has long lain at the center of
  Western culture: "Know thyself," advised the Delphic oracle,
  classical Greece's version of self-help therapy. "To thine own
  self be true," Shakespeare counseled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However,
  mutating lifestyles and changing intellectual currents have led a
  group of increasingly influential psychologists -- postmodern
  psychologists seems to be the name that is sticking -- to the
  conclusion that we have no single, separate, unified self. They
  maintain that we contain many selves and that the proper response
  to the suggestion "Get in touch with yourself" or "Be yourself"
  is "Which one?"</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Hazel Rose
  Markus, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan,
  calls this "the most exciting time in psychology in decades and
  decades." We have begun to realize, she says, that "there isn't
  just one answer to the 'Who am I?' question."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider,
  as an example, the individual named Mick Jagger. The Rolling
  Stones' lead singer was and, if the tabloids are to be believed,
  remains a classic libertine, but he is also a father and, until
  recently at least, a family man. Jagger is a rock 'n' roller, a
  bohemian, whose songs and lifestyle challenge traditional
  standards of behavior; yet he travels in upper-class British
  circles, hobnobbing with dukes and princesses. Jagger can be
  coarse and crude, yet he knows his nonfiction and his
  vintages.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Which is
  the real Mick? His answer: all of the above. "People find it very
  hard to accept that you can be all these things at almost the
  same time," Jagger has complained.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Relax,
  Mick. The times seem to be catching up with you once again. This
  new group of psychologists starts from the assumption that there
  is no single Mick, just a rotating bunch of possible Micks,
  changing as the people you are with and the situations you are in
  change. And, these psychologists believe, similarly disparate
  groups of selves, if less wealthy and less famous, inhabit us
  all. Like Walt Whitman, we "contain multitudes."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Healthy
  multitudes. We are not talking here of those who suffer from
  "multiple personality disorder." That nightmarish condition
  (chronicled in popular books and movies) is characterized by
  dissociative states in which a personality "splits" into
  different selves with different memories, some of which appear to
  know nothing about the other selves. No, we are talking about
  healthy people, like Jagger, who don't blank out, who are quite
  aware of everything they are doing, but who have, quite
  naturally, created different selves to relate to different
  aspects of their multifaceted lives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"There are
  people who can live very comfortably and successfully with a
  multiple vision of who they are," says Cal State Northridge
  psychology professor Edward Sampson. "And they don't go to
  traditional therapists unless they want to get that knocked out
  of them."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This is
  not, its proponents contend, just another provocative theory. It
  is a response to some feelings that, in this fractured,
  complicated, media-saturated, post-"Ozzie and Harriet" world, are
  very much in the air. There is the sense that we are often, if
  not always, playing -- at work, at our relationships, even at
  parenthood; the sense that each of us can switch roles as easily
  as we switch costumes -- from business person to jock, from
  backpacker to sophisticate, from nurturer to sex
  object.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  implications of the theory are large: It's not just that we each
  have different sides to our personality; it's that we have no
  central personality in relation to which all our varied behaviors
  might be seen as just "sides." We are, in other words, not
  absolutely anything.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"The true
  self is dead," proclaims Walter Truett Anderson, author of
  "Reality Isn't What It Used to Be," a primer on
  postmodernism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">IF YOU
  FIND THIS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW, you're not alone. Some
  psychologists consider the whole issue a waste of time. "It
  doesn't matter if it's one self or two or three or 5,000," scoffs
  Robert Zajonc, director of the Institute for Social Research at
  the University of Michigan and Markus' husband. Zajonc, who has
  spent much of his life in Europe, finds this preoccupation with
  the self -- or selves -- typically American. "I don't think of my
  self, as such," he says. "I may think of my schedule, my
  obligations, my meetings, but I don't really spend too much time
  asking, 'Who am I?' "</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Others who
  do spend time asking are disturbed by the suggestion that there
  isn't one answer. After all, the idea that we each have a single
  identity, one true self -- just as we each have one true nose and
  one true medical history -- does have a certain seductiveness.
  Our friends and acquaintances don't seem to have much trouble
  dealing with each of us as if we were a constant, consistent
  entity. Why should we?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"People
  certainly are capable of experiencing themselves as having a
  relative unity," says Louis Sass, a Rutgers clinical psychology
  professor who has been critical of some of these new ideas. "They
  have in the past, and I doubt that has changed much."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Kenneth
  Gergen, a Swarthmore psychology professor whose book, "The
  Saturated Self: Dilemmas of Identity in Contemporary Life,"
  provides the best introduction to postmodern psychology, notes a
  similar resistance to his postmodern perspective among some of
  his students. " 'It's just empirically wrong,' they say, or,
  'That's just your point of view.' I've had students who've
  complained to the deans that this idea was really so antithetical
  to their values that they felt it was injurious to the student
  body."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Gergen,
  who is wont to question traditional notions of truth and reality
  as well as identity, understands his students' disquiet. Belief
  in a single self is so basic to our culture, to the ways each of
  us has of thinking and talking about what we call "ourself," that
  it cannot be easily surrendered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Gergen
  "himself," however, began having trouble with the "Who am I?"
  question, and therefore came into conflict with this language,
  when he was only 9. "I grew up in a family that was very
  educated, very cultured," Gergen says. His father was a professor
  and one of his brothers is David Gergen, the former Reagan media
  wizard, now a MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour commentator. "I had a whole
  way of being in that family which was virtually required, but
  then I got deposited in a county school in rural North Carolina.
  And there was no way I could be the person I was at home in that
  school system, so I kind of fought to stay alive by changing my
  whole accent, my way of talking, my way of being." That made two
  selves: the self Gergen used at home and the self he used in
  school.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Then
  there was another transition," Gergen recalls. "This time to a
  city school, which had a whole different set of concerns, which
  again weren't the ones in my family. And then I went from that
  city school to Yale, which required that I leave the Southern
  thing behind." So Gergen had to "make" yet another identity for
  himself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">While in
  graduate school at Duke, he read the psychological literature
  that argued the importance to our mental well-being of
  maintaining a unified, centralized, coherent self. "But it just
  made no sense, given my experience," he explains. "Now I could
  either say, 'I'm very sick,' or I could say, 'This literature has
  got to be wrong.' " Gergen has been challenging the traditional
  psychological understanding of the self off and on ever since.
  And lately he has had lots of help.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A group of
  counselors and therapists, for example, has begun noting that we
  all must "create" other selves as we leave our families in search
  of friendship, success and love -- and then move on to new
  friendships, new successes and new loves. Social psychologists
  have begun studying not only our "child selves," our
  "professional selves," our "friendship selves" and our "parent
  selves," but also what Hazel Markus labels our "possible selves,"
  our "feared possible selves," our "ideal selves," our "fleeting
  selves," our "tentative selves" and our "chronically accessible
  selves."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Philosophers have pointed out that the self divides the
  moment we start looking for it: There is the self that we're
  trying to find plus the self that is doing the looking, plus the
  self within which this game of hide and seek is being played.
  Even the practice of placing an alarm clock out of reach in the
  bedroom implies that we have at least two selves -- a responsible
  nighttime self and a lazy morning self.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But
  perhaps the most interesting support for Gergen's position has
  come from those philosophers of mind, cognitive psychologists and
  biologists who investigate the workings of consciousness. When
  they examine the gray matter or interrogate their computer models
  in search of something that might pass for a self, they come up
  empty. It's not there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Our
  common-sense notion is of the self as a sort of inner boss, a
  sort of puppeteer inside the body, who is in charge," says Daniel
  Dennett, author of "Consciousness Explained." "So that, for
  instance, when I talk my vocal apparatus is being controlled as
  if there was some homunculus, sitting at a mighty theater organ,
  making the words come out, as if my body speaks on behalf of this
  sort of central meaner on the inside. But as soon as you look
  closely at this notion of self, it seems to break
  down."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Dennett's
  research into the workings of consciousness has convinced him
  that there is no "homunculus" or little person, no "central
  meaner," no "ghostly supervisor," no "benevolent dictator,"
  sitting there at the center of the brain, making decisions for
  the rest of the mind and watching consciousness like an audience
  might watch a movie. There is, in other words, no point of pure
  Dennettness, no "brain pebble," somewhere in Dennett's head that
  contains his identity or self. Consciousness, instead, is a
  rather sloppy, multilayered thing in which various takes on
  reality, supplied by our various perceptual and cognitive organs,
  supersede each other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But if
  there is no kernel of selfness inside our brains, why do we all
  seem to start with this common-sense notion of a single,
  separate, unified self? The answer may be that not all people do.
  Here Gergen's view has gotten some support from anthropology and
  our increasing awareness of other cultures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I took a
  trip to Japan," says Markus, "and that, as a social psychologist,
  is a journey that alters your world altogether. That's where I
  really saw great differences in the answer that gets given to the
  'Who am I?' question." The Japanese, Markus learned and confirmed
  in subsequent research projects, do not look upon the self as
  being nearly as separate and self-contained as Americans
  do.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Here,
  there's a real press to individuate yourself, to be special and
  unique, to separate from others, to be your own person," Markus
  says. "It's encoded in all our sacred texts and documents: We
  want independence and liberty and to be free. As Americans we're
  absolutely fearful of showing that we're a social or a group
  product in some way. We need to see ourselves as bounded wholes.
  But in Japan, the common view is that the individual is just a
  fraction. You can only be whole there when you fit in with
  groups.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">From an
  anthropological or historical perspective, it is the American
  conception of an isolated, unified self -- the conception most of
  us take for granted -- that may be the exception. "Our view of
  the self has a history," says Philip Cushman, of the California
  School of Professional Psychology in Berkeley. "It comes from a
  tradition of self-contained individualism." That I-gotta-be-me!
  tradition, a compulsion to do things "my way," may never have
  been stronger than it has been in 20th-Century
  America.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">An escape
  from this exaggerated individualism is, for Gergen, one of the
  major benefits of the theory of multiple selves. Gergen defines
  those various selves as "the capacities we carry within us for
  multiple relationships." We have, for example, selves for
  relating with our bosses, selves for our subordinates, selves
  reserved for our friends and selves that come to life only in the
  presence of certain someones.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">These
  selves, despite what we like to think here in America, are not
  our property alone. They are not just "discovered" within us.
  They are "created" in our relationships with other people. It
  probably will take a child, or at least the thought of a child,
  to help you create yourself as a parent. You may never have an
  opportunity to create a certain romantic, moonstruck,
  poetry-writing self unless you pick up the scent of Mr. or Ms.
  Right. "You can't be a self by yourself," Markus
  concludes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Our selves
  are the product of what Gergen calls -- with a nod to the
  Japanese -- "relatedness." And Gergen (exhibiting a hopeful self)
  believes that acknowledging our various selves and accepting our
  "relatedness" is a route to the psychologist's ever-present goal:
  improved mental health.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THIS SAN
  DIEGO WOMAN WAS frazzled, anxious and depressed -- "at times
  really anxious and deeply depressed," reports psychologist
  Maureen O'Hara. "She exhibited, in other words, typical
  late-20th-Century symptoms."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The woman
  worked in the Navy, as a medic. She went home to a husband and
  three children. And on holidays she returned to the village in
  Mexico where she had been reared. Tough sailor one moment,
  gentle, nurturing mom the next, deferential daughter every few
  months -- perhaps not the typical late-20th-Century life, but
  characteristically wide-ranging and scattered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  woman's problem, it soon became apparent, was the tension, the
  conflict, between her disparate roles. Which of these selves was
  really her? "She couldn't reconcile them," O'Hara says. She had
  no good answer to the "Who am I?" question.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">O'Hara,
  president of the Assn. for Humanistic Psychology, is one of those
  who have begun to use the ideas of postmodern psychology to treat
  patients. She says acceptance of multiple selves turned out to be
  the key to relieving that San Diego woman's anxiety and
  depression. "We worked for a while, and she realized she didn't
  have to reconcile the three worlds she lived in," O'Hara says.
  "She didn't have to worry about being consistent. She could honor
  all these different selves. The woman described it as 'allowing
  each personality to get out of the way of the others.'
  "</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Sass, of
  Rutgers and author of the forthcoming book "Madness and
  Modernism," acknowledges that there might be some "rigid" people
  for whom learning that they can allow themselves to express
  different sides of their personality might have therapeutic
  value. "But," he asks in a recent critique of "the postmodern
  turn in contemporary psychoanalysis": "What of those who suffer
  from problems of a different sort -- for example, from feelings
  of emptiness, meaninglessness and unrelatedness; from the
  inability to form stable relationships, or from a lack of
  sustaining interests or continuing goals, values and ideals?"
  These problems, too, as Sass notes, are "characteristic of our
  age." By surrendering our belief in a true self, don't we risk
  aggravating them?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Maybe not.
  Maybe it is the separate, unified self -- the one that
  traditional psychotherapists are still trying to help us "find"
  or "realize" -- that is causing these feelings of "emptiness,
  meaninglessness and unrelatedness." Maybe our feelings of
  inadequacy have grown with the inevitable frustrations of the
  effort to locate and bolster this mythical "true self." Maybe we
  have spent too many hours on too many couches trying to determine
  who we really are. Maybe by accepting, as that San Diego woman
  did, the idea that our identities come from our relationships, we
  could find a way out of the psychological desert in which some of
  us now wander.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THE WORD
  POSTMODERN HAS been stretched over a lot of different ideas, but
  the central one seems to be that our way of looking at the world
  is not a given, that we create what we see as "reality" through
  language. This view has at least as many detractors among
  academics as supporters. Berkeley philosopher John Searle, for
  example, has debated angrily with Gergen at academic conferences
  whether "reality" is in fact just a creation of language.
  "Science is based on the supposition of an independently existing
  reality," Searle maintains. "If you don't believe in that then
  you're out of business."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Gergen,
  however, argues that we "construct" reality through the stories
  -- the narratives -- we tell about it. Other societies, for
  example, have told other stories about such seemingly basic
  matters as mental illness, emotions, and thought -- and therefore
  these concepts had a different "reality" for them. Our
  identities, too, Gergen maintains, are constructed -- products of
  different stories we tell ourselves about ourselves.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">Postmodernism is based on some difficult theories
  (poststructuralism, deconstruction, etc.) hatched, for the most
  part, in France, but somehow this new view of psychology seems
  most at home in America, particularly California. In an insular,
  homogeneous Old World town it might have been possible for people
  to define themselves in terms of a single belief, a single way of
  life, but not here. Not where we are tugged at by so many
  possible belief systems and lifestyles -- each of which presents
  us with new "possible selves."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1">"California has always been where the idea of the possible
  came from," says Markus, who grew up in San Diego. "There is a
  bit of Hollywood in everyone in California -- the sense that you
  can be other than who you are now, that you can kind of create
  yourself."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And why
  settle for creating just one self? Indeed, how could you settle
  for creating just one self in a world where even adults are
  encouraged to play, a world where we can trade in our one "true"
  nose for a shorter version, a world where we can move from one
  identity to another -- with a change of clothes, a change of
  channel, an unexpected phone call -- as easily as we might move
  from Main Street to Adventureland at Disneyland?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Gergen and
  friends say they did not invent this new postmodern world. They
  are just trying to help us adjust to it. Don't agonize over
  consistency or authenticity, they advise. Enjoy
  yourselves!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But if
  this is indeed where we're headed, some questions must be
  answered. Questions about ethics and morality, to begin with.
  Sass, for one, is not at all sanguine about this acceptance of
  inconsistency and inauthenticity. "There are clearly dangers in
  giving up that notion of a single self," he notes. "You absolve
  the person of responsibility for making judgments." Imagine the
  excuses people might make: "Hey, it wasn't my fault. One of my
  other selves did it."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Absolving
  people of responsibility for their behavior, however, is not at
  all what O'Hara has in mind for postmodern psychology. Instead,
  she hopes these new views of identity will cause us to reopen
  "the ethical conversation" and produce some original ideas on how
  people -- multiselved people -- can be held "accountable to each
  other." The issue might not be who we really are but whether our
  various selves can ethically share the same body.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Gergen
  attempts to construct an ethics of postmodernism upon a slightly
  different foundation: He places his faith in the concept of
  "relatedness." If we become aware of the extent to which our
  selves are created with others, Gergen contends, perhaps we'll be
  more, not less, responsible in our dealings with those others --
  more aware of the debt we owe them, less likely to think we can
  "find ourself" by leaving them behind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Perhaps.
  Still, the issue of how our various selves are going to deal with
  others' various selves in this new postmodern world remains
  problematic. If everybody is plural, how do we decide whom we
  like and whom we dislike? How, if our identities are constantly
  subject to change, do we know whom it is we're talking to, whom
  we're taking a shine to? These questions might be combined into
  one question: How can two people who know all this be, gulp, in
  love?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"My wife
  and I went through this painfully at first," confesses Gergen,
  whose wife, Mary, is also a psychology professor. "This is a
  second marriage for both of us, kind of a romantic thing: We ran
  away from the world. So, early on in our marriage, she'd
  frequently ask me whether I still loved her." And Gergen, who was
  trying to think out some of these psychological issues, didn't
  know how to respond: "What exactly as a psychological event could
  love mean? And how could I do an introspective examination of all
  my interior to know whether it was still there or not?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"Finally,
  she said, 'Look, when I ask you whether you love me, don't go
  through these tortuous questions of what's really real about love
  and how you'd know. Just say the words meaningfully, and I'll be
  a lot better off.' "</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And that
  may be the key to life in the postmodern world. We will have to
  do our best to say words like "I love you" meaningfully -- even
  though we sense there are dozens of "I's," not all of whom can be
  in agreement on anything, even though we know we'll never pin
  down whom "you" really might be. We will have to learn to make
  do, in other words, with rituals and approximations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">"I don't
  think we need someone to love all 93 of our selves," Markus says.
  "If someone just takes three or four of them real seriously,
  that's enough to keep most of us going on most days."</font></p>
