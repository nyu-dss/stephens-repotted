  <p><font face="Courier New">BYLINE: By <a href=
  "MS_Home.html">Mitchell Stephens</a>. Mitchell Stephens will
  become chairman of the New York University Department of
  Journalism in August. He is the author of "A History of News"
  (Penguin).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">BODY:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">PENN STATE UNIVERSITY'S recent
  decision to make Pepsi-Cola its official everage in return for
  $14 million should awaken all of us in academe to a new world of
  fund-raising opportunities.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Times, of course, are tough on
  campus. Federal and state aid has been slashed. Endowment income
  is down. And fewer students can come up with the tuition.
  University budgets have all suffered substantial cuts. We
  academics can no longer afford to indulge the old-fashioned
  notion that a university is above commercialism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">In America today, of course,
  everything can be sold. At the ballpark they now have sponsors
  for the out-of-town scores, sponsors for replays; soon they could
  be selling the innings: "Now batting for the Mets in the
  Budweiser bottom of the seventh . . . " Rock stars, who used to
  sing of how money can't buy love, now - intimately aware of what
  it can buy - perform under huge banners promoting diet sodas. And
  thousands of high schools, in exchange for free video equipment,
  make their students sit still for a TV show that mixes news with
  sneaker commercials.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">For classy enterprises like ballet
  companies or universities, given the high deficits we currently
  run and the desire the rich have to be associated with us,
  selling out becomes a particularly attractive proposition. I am
  proud to report that plaques thanking Sony, Time Inc., Shell Oil,
  Hoffman LaRouche and Dow Jones now grace the walls of Arthur L.
  Carter Hall, the home of the NYU Journalism Department. Their
  money makes some of our programs possible. But after learning of
  Penn State's windfall from Pepsi, I realize that our efforts to
  enter the marketplace have been much too timid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">To get the money, Penn State agreed
  to turn over billboard space, scoreboard advertising, elements of
  cafeteria design and all soda sales on its 21 campuses to Pepsi
  for 10 years. I can't offer a whole university, but I can offer
  some unique opportunities to donors:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Package No. 1. In return for enough
  funding to restore our department's full office staff, allow
  freer use of a photocopy machine and permit faculty to attend
  occasional academic conferences, I will begin and end each of my
  lectures with the slogan of your choice. I don't have the pipes
  actually to warble a jingle, but, if you throw in a funded
  research trip every once in a while, I would agree to play a
  product theme softly in the background during the
  lectures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Package No. 2. In return for
  increased student aid funding in our department - including,
  perhaps, a few more graduate assistantships - I will tape to the
  blackboard behind me during each of my lectures a 3-by-5-foot
  billboard with the slogan or sponsorship message of your choice.
  Care will be taken, of course, to provide the proper atmosphere
  for appreciating the billboard's message; were the sponsor Rupert
  Murdoch, for example, my discussion of sensationalism and
  journalism ethics would be modified. To reach students during
  office visits, the billboard design might be replicated on my
  tie.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">Package No. 3. In return for a
  supplemental grant that allows us to hire enough faculty to teach
  all the department's courses for 10 years at salaries
  approaching, let's say, two-thirds of what we might earn
  off-campus, I would go considerably beyond the endowed
  professorships we now routinely offer. I will adopt legally the
  middle name of your choice. My new name - "Mitchell AT&amp;T The
  Right Choice Stephens," perhaps - will then appear in all course
  listings and atop all my books, papers, articles and opinion
  pieces. In return for a 20-year faculty-hiring grant, I am
  willing also to change my children's names.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">All these deals are open to
  corporations, advertising and public relations agencies and rich
  people of every stripe. In the new spirit of plutocrat-scholar
  cooperation, I will not discriminate on the basis of product
  safety, worker treatment, environmental responsibility or
  rapacity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New">And these deals will have an added
  benefit: They will help remind students that in 1992 there is no
  longer any corner of American life where wealth does not hold
  sway.</font></p>
