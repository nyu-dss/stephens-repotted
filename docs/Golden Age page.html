  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=
  "+1"><b><font size="+3" color="#808000">A golden age for
  newspapers?</font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">What
  happens to an established form of communication when a new one
  starts taking over? This is an old question for newspaper
  watchers, but I'm proposing a new answer: Often a golden age
  happens.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider
  movies in the increasingly television-obsessed late sixties and
  early seventies. Many critics now believe that was when
  filmmaking in America was most creative, most
  original.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider
  also what happened to theater when print was moving in on
  England, say about the year 1600. Shakespeare was among those
  content to toil away in that old, presumably outdated
  medium.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But
  newspapers? Today? With their circulations on a seemingly endless
  decline? With cautious corporate functionaries ensconced at the
  top of most mastheads? After all those stories about
  Monica?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The case
  for a golden age begins with the look of our papers. Those
  stuffy, gray ladies of yesteryear now wear colors and look almost
  fashionable. Increasingly they are not just laid out, but
  designed. And this makeover has not merely been cosmetic. It
  includes more revealing illustrations, much better charts, more,
  and more thoughtful, listings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And,
  surprisingly, there�s more news in most American papers now. Carl
  Stepp, writing in the American Journalism Review, demonstrated
  this by counting column inches in newspapers thirty-five years
  ago.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Stepp also
  concluded that newspaper writing has gotten much better. This
  won�t seem so shocking if you�ve had occasion recently to plow
  through the lengthy, fact-dense paragraphs that squat atop most
  stories preserved on microfilm. No newspaper journalist today may
  deserve comparison with Shakespeare � or even with Ernie Pyle �
  but most do at least TRY to write more lucidly, more engagingly,
  more analytically.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And as for
  coverage� Well, if you believe the news world begins and ends in
  city halls and state capitals then this is certainly no golden
  age for you. Same if you miss the ideologically charged days of
  the cold war. But those of us who think there�s also news in
  corporations, hip hop, romance, migraines and migrations have
  never found so much of interest in our dailies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  explanation for this apparent golden age? Competition with
  television and now the Internet is, happily, forcing newspapers
  to do more, to be different, to do better. Movies thirty years
  ago were inspired by a similar challenge from
  television.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Newspapers
  today are also catering to increasingly elite, better-educated
  audiences. The less-educated, unhappily, have been abandoning
  newspapers, mostly in favor of television, just when there may be
  good reason to stay.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Not that
  it is possible to pick up an American newspaper today without
  finding a couple of blown leads or missed stories. I said golden
  age, not perfect age.</font></p>
