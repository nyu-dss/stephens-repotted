  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is
  investigative journalism at its most compelling. You suspect that
  a supermarket chain is selling old meat. Get some people jobs in
  one of their stores and place tiny, hidden cameras on them. If
  you�re right and everything goes according to plan, then the
  evidence will be there on camera, on screen � shots of employees
  affixing new dates to packages of old meat. But this is also, as
  American news organizations have been learning in the past
  decade, investigative journalism at its most ethically
  questionable.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In its
  early decades television journalists struggled with the problem
  of what to show. Too often cameras weren�t on the scene � as the
  injustice, for example, was perpetrated. Words could recreate. A
  camera couldn�t. But these miniature cameras can now go anywhere
  a reporter, even an undercover reporter, can go. Injustices can
  be exposed to view, not just recounted. A new, properly visual,
  drama has been added to television news. And in the United States
  in the 1990s that drama certainly has been welcomed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">To
  understand this it is necessary to recall another way in which
  television journalism has changed: In its early decades it was,
  even in its advertising-dominated American incarnation, a
  relatively genteel business. Network newscasts, local newscasts
  secured good will and made money. But with the proliferation of
  channels and networks in the 1980s and 1990s that is not always
  so. And with networks and stations being shuffled between
  corporations like playing cards that is not always enough. The
  television news business in the United States is no longer
  genteel; it is money hungry.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">News
  programming � particularly hour-length, multi-subject "magazine"
  shows � are now viewed as a relatively inexpensive, high-profit
  way to fill some of those channels, even during "prime-time"
  evening hours. There are now three all-news networks in the
  United States (CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC) and, the last time I
  made my way through the increasingly complex television schedule,
  two prime-time magazine shows on one or another of the three
  major networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) every day of the week except
  Saturday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  competition for hot, ratings-drawing news on these shows is
  intense, and only so many exclusive interviews with Monica
  Lewinsky are available. Hidden cameras can help.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">They have
  been placed by journalists working for network magazine shows
  under automobiles to show phony repairs by shady mechanics. These
  lipstick-size cameras have been secreted in day care centers and
  hospitals to show children or patients being abused. They have
  followed black and white couples as they try to rent the same
  apartment. Two shows in particular were known for their liberal
  and creative use of these undercover techniques: ABC�s PrimeTime
  Live (which has now been merged into that network�s 20/20) and
  Dateline NBC. But local newscasts have purchased their own
  miniature cameras. Mouse droppings on a supermarket floor?
  Captured on video.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Injustices
  have been exposed by these hidden cameras. Ratings have been
  secured. And some stomachs have grown queasy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The most
  talked about and controversial of these hidden-camera exposes was
  PrimeTime Live�s incursion into two Food Lion supermarkets in
  1992. ABC�s broadcast of videotape showing old meat being redated
  and even repackaged caused an 11 percent, or about $1.9 billion,
  drop in the company�s stock price the next day. Food Lion went to
  court.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In 1997 a
  jury found that the ABC employees who had surreptitiously
  obtained jobs at the two supermarkets in order to sneak the tiny
  cameras in were guilty of fraud, trespass and breach of "loyalty"
  to their ostensible employer. ABC was asked to pay $5.5 million
  in punitive damages to Food Lion. That amount was later reduced
  to $315,000, and in October 1999 an appeals court threw out the
  fraud claim and reduced the damages to a total of two
  dollars.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Other
  lawsuits have been filed against television news organizations
  that have used hidden cameras, on charges ranging from invasion
  of privacy to defamation. (See Brill�s Content article.) Most
  have not been successful. Nevertheless, journalists using these
  techniques have grown more cautious, and an ethical debate on
  when or if they should be used has raged.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Robert
  Lissit, a former network television producer writing in the
  American Journalism Review in 1995, presented a few examples of
  highly questionable uses of hidden cameras by local news
  organizations in the United States. Lissit�s list included a
  station in St. Louis that placed a male prostitute and a camera
  in a hotel room in an effort to get a priest to talk about the
  sexual activities of members of the clergy. It included a station
  in Schenectady, New York, that fixed a high school girl up with a
  hidden camera to obtain shots of discipline problems. I have also
  seen such cameras used, for example, to catch welfare recipients
  bragging about their lies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Most of
  the issues raised by hidden cameras parallel those raised on
  other occasions where journalists go undercover, misrepresent
  themselves or try to entrap citizens into committing or revealing
  illegal behaviors. Would it have been any more legitimate for a
  newspaper to use a prostitute and a hotel room to obtain verbal,
  not visual, evidence that priests were having sex?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Critics of
  hidden cameras point out that videotape can easily be edited to
  make matters look worse. Food Lion argued, for example, that ABC
  had left out scenes where supermarket employees had refused to
  redate old meat. But descriptions and quotes in a newspaper can
  also be used selectively and used to distort. Is the potential
  deception more serious because video looks so much more real and
  believable than newspaper writing? Only if the audience is naïve
  enough to discount the possibility of selective
  editing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is
  difficult to imagine any circumstances where journalists in any
  medium would be justified in encouraging someone to commit a
  crime � such as patronizing a prostitute. Circumstances do appear
  to exist where journalists might be justified in going
  undercover. In 1887 the intrepid New York World reporter Nellie
  Bly pretended to be insane for ten days to expose conditions in a
  notorious asylum. In order to research his 1906 novel, The
  Jungle, Upton Sinclair secretly wandered about a Chicago
  meat-packing plant; his expose led to the passage of U.S.
  regulations on food cleanliness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Still,
  such circumstances � in which journalists essentially assume the
  right to lie � are limited. The injustices or hazards to public
  welfare involved must be very large, as they seem to have been in
  Bly�s asylum and Sinclair�s meat-packing plant. A huge
  supermarket chain whose policies allegedly create health risks
  might qualify. A small local grocer who is a little lazy with the
  broom would not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And,
  journalism ethicists who have begun debating these matters in the
  United States agree, it should be clear that there is no other
  good way to obtain the story. ABC argued that simply having
  former employees come on camera to charge that Food Lion redated
  old meat would have made for a much weaker story. Company
  spokespeople would then have accused them of lying. The public
  would have been left in doubt. But if the story is government
  corruption the case can often best be made by legally obtained
  documents not by sneaking undercover reporters or "spy cams," as
  they are now known at some local stations, into government
  offices.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Were
  investigative journalists � with or without hidden cameras � to
  disregard such strictures, we would risk having a kind of
  auxiliary police force checking up on our lives: reporters hidden
  on the roads to see who is driving too fast, reporters undercover
  in accountants� offices to see who is cheating on taxes,
  reporters staking out hotels to see who is sleeping with
  whom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There is
  one significant way in which hidden cameras do increase the
  threat to privacy and even personal freedom that investigative
  reporting can pose: They show faces. It is one thing for a
  reporter to stand outside a welfare office and then print,
  without names, stories of cheating; it is quite another to
  broadcast to millions of homes pictures of some loose-lipped
  individual who had no idea his comments were going to be made
  public. Similarly, it is one thing to interview students about
  discipline problems, quite another to publicly humiliate a few
  misbehaving teenagers or lax teachers by sneaking a
  television-news camera into a school.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Technology
  is now available that can enable television journalists to blur
  out faces. It probably should be used liberally.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Hidden
  cameras, like other forms of investigative journalism, can do
  good things � for society as well as for ratings. But many
  observers of television news in the United States now argue that
  they should be used very sparingly.</font></p>
