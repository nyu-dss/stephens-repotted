  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3" color=

  immaturity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Every new
  technology � and this certainly includes every new communications
  technology -- goes through a period when it is immature and
  unformed. The Model-T stage, we might call it. This period can
  last a long time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Writing,
  for example, was invented in Sumeria and Eygpt more than five
  thousand years ago. But, for the first five hundred years of its
  history, scribes did little more than record business
  transactions and data on the flooding of the Nile. For the first
  five hundred years of writing, in other words, no one thought to
  scribble down a story.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  earliest newspapers � four hundred years ago -- began as lists of
  items presented as they arrived in the print shop: Someone's
  political prospects might be touted on page one; that person's
  death reported on page five. The first editor that we know of �
  the first person charged with placing news items in some coherent
  order � did not appear until many years later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There are
  countless other examples of new forms of communications
  struggling to find their way. And one thing all these "new media"
  have in common during this stumbling Model-T stage is that hardly
  anyone is aware that this is the stage they are at. In the first
  few centuries of printing, for example, no one announced that the
  products of their presses were still primitive and imagined them
  eventually being replaced by Tolstoy or The New Yorker. We
  usually see ourselves as standing at � or, more commonly, past �
  the apogee of human artistic and intellectual progress, not
  somewhere on the upward slope.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The
  Model-T stage is, of course, precisely where the Internet is
  currently at. (TV, I would argue, hasn�t gotten much further.)
  Despite all the billions of dollars that are now being gambled on
  the Internet�s future, it seems unlikely that we are any better
  at envisioning that future than folks in Henry Ford�s time were
  at envisioning interstates or malls or even cars that didn�t
  require cranking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Clicking
  our way around the Web can certainly be interesting. Undoubtedly
  driving a Model-T seemed pretty cool at the time, too. However,
  it is quite likely that we have not yet seen the developments
  that will do for the Internet what the story did for writing, or
  what the editor did for the newspaper, or what the gear shift did
  for the automobile. When it comes to the Internet, we are still
  dealing with, to continue the analogy, a car with running boards
  and without side windows, and we are still � users, analysts,
  investors � driving unpaved roads.</font></p>
