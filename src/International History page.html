<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3" color="#800040">A Call 
  for an International History of Journalism</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a href="MS_Home.html"><font size="+2">Mitchell 
  Stephens</font></a></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><i><font color="#FF8000">American 
  Journalism</font></i></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">There is, to be blunt about 
  it, no such thing as a history of American journalism. The development of American 
  journalism was influenced – if not transformed, if not determined – in every 
  period by developments outside of America. To pretend otherwise, as we too often 
  do in our courses and our writings, is to distort history. American journalism 
  did not, in any sense, develop alone.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This fact about journalism 
  history does not have to be understood historically. It is plain enough in our 
  own era. In what country today do the media evolve in isolation? </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The United States may currently 
  be the major source of forms of communication that wander across borders. However, 
  the United States is certainly not immune to having its own borders transgressed. 
  People – Rupert Murdoch and Tina Brown are examples – have brought strategies 
  here from elsewhere. Corporations – Bertelsmann, Murdoch’s News Corporation 
  – have made significant incursions. Ideas are borrowed from foreign publications, 
  foreign television shows, foreign Web sites. Would, to pick a notable example, 
  NPR be possible without the BBC or CBC?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It was, of course, ever 
  thus. Indeed, this point would have been as obvious to American journalists 
  in earlier centuries as it now is to journalists elsewhere in the world, who 
  feel the influence of CNN or <I>Newsweek</I>. For America then was much more 
  the recipient than the source of ideas.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">My favorite example currently 
  hangs on my living room wall. I purchased it for a couple of hundred dollars 
  a few years ago. It is a small and not particularly rare newspaper called <I>Domestick 
  Intelligence, Or News both from City and Country</I> and published in London 
  on August 5, 1679. This newspaper was of significance in England at the time, 
  both for its emphasis upon local news and its precocious sensationalism. (My 
  copy includes a story about a man who was stabbed in a bar fight.) </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However, my interest in 
  <I>Domestick Intelligence</I> derives primarily from its publisher. The name 
  printed at the bottom of the second and last page is &quot;Benjamin Harris.&quot; 
  In other words, this newspaper was published by the man who would, eleven years 
  later, publish America’s first newspaper. That newspaper, <I>Publick Occurrences, 
  Both Foreign and Domestick</I>, looked quite a bit like its older brother on 
  my wall. It can best be understood, as can its publisher, as a product of late-seventeenth-century 
  London journalism. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And this is hardly the 
  only evidence of the absurdity of delaying the start of the history of journalism, 
  as we too often do, until 1690, when a newspaper first appears in England’s 
  American colonies. As F&eacute;lix Guti&eacute;rrez has reported, a news publication, 
  though not a periodical, had been printed in Mexico City in 1541. (This too, 
  of course, was the younger sibling of much older European newsbooks.)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The word that probably 
  appeared most in the titles of early colonial newspapers was &quot;gazette.&quot; 
  Boston’s first newspaper was the <I>Boston Gazette</I>; New York’s first, the 
  <I>New York Gazette</I>; Maryland’s first, the <I>Maryland Gazette</I>; and 
  Benjamin Franklin took over and made a success of the <I>Pennsylvania Gazette</I>. 
  This too, of course, was a borrowing from Europe. The most influential newspaper 
  in France in the seventeenth century was the <I>Gazette de France</I>. The most 
  influential newspaper in England in that century was the <I>London Gazette</I>.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Indeed, this is a word 
  that turns up over and over again throughout the history of the newspaper. Russians 
  actually call their newspapers &quot;<I>gazeta.&quot;</I> The word can be traced 
  back to handwritten newssheets – sometimes known as <I>gazzette</I> – distributed 
  weekly, as I have shown in my <I>book A History of News</I>, in Venice as early 
  as 1566. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Venice in the mid-sixteenth 
  century is, consequently, one place a history of journalism, at least newspaper 
  journalism, might begin. I believe a genetic examination of every newspaper 
  in America, along with every newspaper published anywhere in the world today, 
  would turn up some DNA that can be traced back to these handwritten weeklies.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The content of American 
  newspapers in the colonial period and beyond consisted primarily, as we know, 
  of items taken from European newspapers. To be an American newspaper printer 
  in 1760 in a port city, consequently, required pouring through as many English, 
  French and other foreign newspapers as it was possible get off the ships. Those 
  papers were generally more advanced in reporting methods, in typography, in 
  design and in writing style than American newspapers. They remained so into 
  the nineteenth century. Our editors, consequently, borrowed more than stories 
  from them. European newspapers provided the forms from which American journalism 
  was cast – and recast.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider just the most 
  obvious contributions from just one country: England. London had a &quot;penny 
  press&quot; before New York had a &quot;penny press.&quot; Reporting developed 
  in London many decades before it came to America. (&quot;To report&quot; was 
  a British term for taking shorthand, and the first regular American &quot;beat&quot; 
  – police court – was inspired, in part, by police court coverage in London.) 
  America’s tabloids were unabashedly based on London’s tabloids. (The term itself 
  was borrowed from the British pharmaceutical industry.) And a late-twentieth-century 
  wave of tabloid journalism in the United States might arguably be traced to 
  the purchase of the <I>New York Post</I> by an Australian who had mastered the 
  art form in London.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Given the extent of European 
  influence upon the American press it is certainly not surprising that the three 
  men who might reasonably be labeled the most creative forces in American journalism 
  were all men who had an opportunity to look at European newspapers before they 
  were loaded onto ships. Two – James Gordon Bennett Sr. and Joseph Pulitzer – 
  were, as were so many great American journalists, immigrants to this country. 
  The third, Benjamin Franklin, spent formative years in England.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">To attempt to separate 
  the history of American journalism from developments overseas seems, therefore, 
  as foolish as attempting to separate the history of journalism in Ohio or Kansas 
  from what was happening in Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Yet we do – over 
  and over again. There are relatively few American journalism historians who 
  are familiar with the history of English or French or German or even Mexican 
  journalism. A kind of ignorance – which would not be tolerated in literature 
  departments, in theater departments, in art departments, in science departments 
  – is routinely accepted in journalism departments. American journalism history 
  is dangerously and unflaggingly parochial.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">However, in this too, although 
  we may be the worst offenders, we are not alone. I have met Dutch and French 
  journalism historians who know an awful lot about the history of, for example, 
  English journalism, but not more than a handful of them. Most English, French, 
  German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese or Italian journalism historians are specialists 
  only in the history of journalism in their own countries.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">As a result, we have a 
  lot of local journalism histories that underplay or ignore the countless notions 
  that drifted across borders in what has always been a cosmopolitan business. 
  As a result, countless potentially instructive parallels remain unexplored. 
  As a result, many of the major stories in this history – stories that are inescapably 
  multi-national – remain untold. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The development of the 
  direct ancestors of the newspaper in early-modern Europe – before and after 
  the Venetian gazettes – is an example. I have done some (primitive) work in 
  this area. There is much more to do. But it is research that will require comparison 
  of early news publications in Italy, Germany, Belgium and Holland, at the very 
  least.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The printed newspaper is 
  at the heart of all of our journalism histories. German researchers recently 
  found evidence that one of what we had thought of as the two earliest European 
  printed newspapers, Johann Carolus’s Strasbourg weekly, had actually begun publication 
  four years earlier – in 1605. In some fields this is news that would instantly 
  race around the world. But I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes decades to find 
  its way into journalism history textbooks in the United States and elsewhere 
  outside of Germany.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Our narrowly nationalistic 
  journalism histories, in other words, not only obscure crucial connections and 
  lineages and ignore telling comparisons, they leave us unable to approach fundamental 
  questions. We must internationalize our conferences, our journals, our graduate 
  programs and our research. Journalism has never been held back by borders. It 
  is time for journalism historians to begin crossing them. </font></P>
