  <blockquote>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Ready to board a 
      ship. Ensconced in fancy resort, most expensive of this trip. All plans 
      set, including complex radio-report arrangements, until I learn this morning, 
      <font color="#804000">January 17</font>, that the ship has been <font color="#804000">delayed</font>...almost 
      one day. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I've been so laid-back 
      on this trip, so relaxed about delays. But the radio arrangements are now 
      messed up. This resort is just a pretty and inefficient holding area -- 
      an island of safety for free-trade-zone businesspeople and their spouses. 
      Last night I asked three different waiters for &quot;la cuenta,&quot; and 
      finally left in a not-at-all-laid-back huff. Two olives roll off my plate 
      to the floor at lunch this afternoon. I can't get a phone call through to 
      home. I can rent a kayak in their little lake, but for $20 per hour. Have 
      to fight over a phone and Internet bill that wanted to be as high as my 
      room bill. And I'm feeling real lonely again. Shit. Perfect reminder that 
      without the car I <font color="#804000">can't just go</font>; I am dependent; 
      I can get stuck.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But the guy on the 
      phone says the ship -- <font color="#804000">my ship</font> -- is finally 
      docking. And my driver, while 45 minutes late, does eventually come. The 
      dog who needs to sniff my backpack also, in time, arrives and manages to 
      look properly uninterested. A van drives us to the massive, floodlit vessel 
      and the purposeful hubbub that surrounds it. I board. My passport will be 
      the captain's responsibility for a while.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="ship"></a>I 
      suspect there are people, even people I know quite well, who would not be 
      <font color="#804000">thrilled</font> to be boarding a huge container <font color="#804000">ship</font> 
      at midnight in Manzanillo, a port next to Colon. I suspect that some would 
      not be smiling this wide as they are led up an awkward walkway, with giant 
      cranes lifting or lowering truck-backs fore and aft. The thought of spending 
      six or seven days with the German officers and Filipino crew of this <font color="#804000">freighter</font>, 
      as it adds to or subtracts from those containers in various Latin American 
      ports, might, I suspect, not be everyone's idea of a dream voyage -- even 
      were they berthed in the &quot;Owner's Cabin&quot; (the only available room 
      on the ship). </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Why is that? Are 
      they not in awe of grand machinery? Is it not a privilege for them to be 
      so positioned that they can see something of the mechanics of human commerce? 
      Do their thoughts not sail when in all directions they can see nothing but 
      sea? Do they not hear the attempts at conversation between the ocean's surface 
      and its depths? Do they not crave the goofy wonder of being where, more 
      obviously than usual, they have no obvious reason to be? Or is it just that 
      they were too young or too old for Kerouac and the romance of denim-clad,

      about the workings of fate as I've pretended to be. That I'm having this 
      dream may also have something to do with the fact that it's five o'clock 
      in the morning on Thursday, <font color="#804000">January 18</font>, and 
      the Sea Jaguar has just started to move.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">I am <font color="#804000">right 
      now</font>, as I type, <font color="#804000">in the Panama Canal</font>. 
      Cool, huh? (Though those who lack my literary bent might wonder why I'm 
      sitting in my cabin playing with a laptop instead of pacing on the dark 
      bridge, listening to the pilot saying stuff like, &quot;starboard twenty.&quot;) 
      I know they have cruise ships going through this thing now. Your aunt and 
      uncle probably took one once. But I'm on a real, honest-to-goodness freighter, 
      which is much cooler. (Okay, how's this? I took my laptop and my beer out 
      on deck.) Right now -- it's 10:05 p.m. -- we're following a path of blinking 
      red and green lights through the lake between the sets of locks on the Atlantic 
      and Pacific sides -- passing little dot islands, hearing faint tweety and 
      chirpy bird or animal sounds along with the putter and metallic vibrations 
      of the big ship itself. (Bet you're glad your Journal keeper took his laptop 
      outside, now!)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Fact is I'm totally 
      into this massive ship elevator. I'm into the international gathering of 
      huge ships -- about two dozen visible at most times -- that was swarming 
      around the Canal's Atlantic mouth all day, waiting their turn to &quot;<font color="#804000">transit</font>.&quot; 
      (We waited more than twelve hours.) I'm into the variety of accents in the 
      English spoken by their captains on the radio, as they asked permission 
      to drop anchor or wondered why the pilot was late. I'm into the fact that 
      the heart of the Canal is a huge man-made lake (that's where all the green-and-red-light, 
      chirpy stuff is happening right now), cause I didn't know that. Until my 
      friend Randy, who drove here on his motorcycle a long time ago, told me, 
      I also didn't know that the Atlantic entrance is actually somewhat to the 
      west of the Pacific entrance. That's <font color="#804000">neat</font> too. 
      I'm into the fact that ships get raised and then lowered about 85 feet -- 
      lifted, as it were, over the Americas and then eased back down to sea level. 
      I'm into the way they flattened the skinny little piece of a continent they 
      got here in order to make the lifting easier. I try not to make too big 
      a deal over the fact that it was Americans who built the damn thing, even 
      though I'm the only American on this ship. I am, however, becoming a big 
      Panama Canal guy. (Damn. Just saw a large, lit-up, wedding-cake cruise ship 
      heading down the Canal the other way.)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="container"></a>And, 
      oh yeah, there's some stuff to say here about <font color="#804000">globalization</font>...and 
      this ship, for example. Built in Korea in 1997. Owned by some Germans -- 
      as part of a complicated tax scheme, I'm told. (Hence the German officers, 
      the European fixtures and the washing machine that takes two and a half 
      hours to do a load.) The <font color="#804000">Sea Jaguar</font>, a <font color="#804000">container 
      ship</font> out of Hamburg. But the ship has been leased to an American 
      company, Crowley American Transport. (The acronym apparently explains the 
      vessel's odd name.) And it spends its time primarily plying the waters of 
      Latin American, moving containers filled with bananas, electronics, cosmetics, 
      ice cream (many are refrigerated), aluminum foil, chemicals, rolls of film 
      for processing in places with looser environmental restrictions, you name 
      it. (Actually, I got one of the guys on board to provide this rough list.) 
      Those containers are themselves one of the best examples of worldwide standardization. 
      Every truck, every railroad car, every ship that wants to get in on this 
      global lugging game has to be prepared to handle a box of one of two precise 
      sizes -- full or half (my Toyota was stuffed into a half). No choice. No 
      alternative. (And that size was chosen to fit American roads.) It ain't 
      digital, but this is real workmanlike globalization, if you ask me.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And, speaking of 
      workmanlike, how about the job this Canal has been doing for the past 86 
      years? The <font color="#804000">Panama Canal</font> was finished just when 
      an earlier age of globalization ended: in August 1914. The telegraph, cables 
      under the oceans, steamships, railroads, the telephone, radio, the first 
      automobiles, the first airplanes. Not a bad little age of innovation they 
      had going for themselves back then. In some ways, as I have written, more 
      world-changing than our own. And this was a time when you could travel around 
      most of the world without a passport. Global trade was booming before the 
      First World War. And the little slit they made in the Americas, this passage 
      into an ocean Europeans didn't even know existed four hundred years earlier, 
      should have been one of the most glorious of these glories. Except that 
      era ended. Europeans set about murdering each other in trenches. A depression 
      came. Various curtains were hung over various parts of the world. Containment. 
      There were more and more places you couldn't travel even with a passport. 
      Our current age of globalization in some sense dates only from 1989.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And guess what's 
      now a big part of it. How do you think -- how did I think -- all those Japanese 
      cars find their way to Long Island? How can they drink Evian in San Francisco? 
      How do Nikes make it to the malls of New Jersey from those cheap factories 
      in Thailand? How do Dells get to Singapore? <font color="#804000">They ain't 
      moving this stuff over the Internet?</font> All those ships waiting their 
      turn -- at tens of thousands a transit. Carrying all that stuff. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Canal construction 
      is hardly cutting edge technology. Just about as old as they come. This 
      one -- made possible by innovations in lock building, mountain leveling 
      and, in particular, disease fighting -- has outlived many of its predecessors 
      (their old mule paths reduced to jogging trails). But our current age of 
      globalization owes a lot to the digging of<font color="#804000"> this particular 
      ditch</font>. It owes a lot also to automobiles, a more than hundred-year-old 
      technology, and airplanes, almost a hundred years old. It is deeply and 
      increasingly in debt, of course, to television, seventy-five years old. 
      And our goods are being lugged through the Canal on what are essentially 
      updated, steel-clad steamships like this one, amalgams of various mostly 
      18th-century technologies.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It takes a while, 
      as I like to say, before such technologies really come into their own. This, 
      not anything Wilber and Orville saw, is really the age of the airplane. 
      The age of the Internet is probably still a long way off. Its great contribution 
      may be to some future age of globalization. And the Panama Canal? They got 
      a sign on one of the buildings saying, in Spanish and English, &quot;<font color="#804000">A</font> 
      <font color="#804000">Canal for a New Millennium</font>.&quot; Hard not 
      to conclude, based on what I've seen today and tonight, that its time is 
      right now.</font></b></p>

      didn't take long for this massive ship to look small. Why do I get such 
      a kick out of these escalating <font color="#804000">reminders of insignificance</font>? 
      Could it be merely philosophical: a reaffirmation of my belief in a primordial 
      and overarching meaninglessness -- Derrida's &quot;impossible&quot;? The 
      religious too, I must admit, are wont to prostrate themselves before the 
      large and unknowable (though their versions exude meaning). A matter of

      Risk Map&quot; (so, for that matter, are Guatemala and El Salvador). But 
      the <font color="#804000">danger</font> in the case of this particular town 
      seems, based on discussions with officers and crew, to be confined to getting 
      mugged, perhaps at knife point, on the rough street between port and town, 
      and that risk can apparently be eliminated by the simple step of taking 
      a taxi past that street. I take a taxi past that street and find a town 
      dressed in dirty whites, a couple of boats permanently aground on the beach, 
      shacks on stilts in the middle of a pier in the water. Why did I expect 
      South America to be better off than Central America? Because the countries 
      are larger? I asked the taxi driver to take me to the tourist area. He shrugged

      for those looking for a jungle holiday. You can put together all sort of 
      adventurous excursions here. You can also do a couple of real touristy things. 
      My last day there, I decide I'd better, given my research interests, do 
      one of those things: see some &quot;natives&quot; in &quot;native costumes.&quot; 
      I hire a boat by myself. Arrive at the site to which the Boros Indians have 
      moved, for this purpose. They wander in wearing bark shorts or skirts, some 
      necklaces or headgear, nothing else. I pay, still by myself, more than I 
      should pay. They dance. I join them for a couple of highly rhythmic numbers. 
      I manage to feel both exploitative and exploited. The joke, of course, is 
      that the Boros change back into jeans and T-shirts as soon as we tourists 
      leave. <font color="#804000">January 29.</font> I buy a hammock for the

      a spell, by some American collection of Whitney always loving yo-oo-oo-oo-ou 
      and Imagine and Harry Nilsson and of course this was enough to make the 
      landscape dance (a kind of ballet I do know from) for me. And of course 
      there were my tapes on my long drive -- inspiring all of Central America 
      to prance and preen for me. And now I am listening to <font color="#804000">the 
      music</font> of another engine. This precious little airplane engine singing 
      over and over, like some otherworldly chorus, a song almost as majestic 
      as the views, a song purer, because it is this way with music, than the 
      views: &quot;It shines for us.&quot; I am hearing this. &quot;It shines 
      for us.&quot; For whom? &quot;It shines for us.&quot; This always perfect 
      -- because I am only imagining it in the middle of the surrounding precious 
      engine roar -- song. For whom? We lovers? We humans? The rivers shine as 
      the reflected sun glides over them. The land shines in that sun haze. Clouds 
      too. We hang -- the pilot, Fritz and I -- here in the sky. I hear and see. 
      I hear to see. I hear music. I see wonders.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">And, 
      no, I do not believe in <font color="#804000">signs</font>, in secret passageways 
      connecting present and future, which might indicate whether my trip will 
      be a delight or a disaster. Instead I content myself with the usual, rough, 
      stupid, cause-and-effect ladders -- pack light and things will be easier, 
      stay out of Colombia and things will be safer-- the ladders we spend our 
      lives climbing. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">But 
      I do believe in <font color="#804000">wonders</font>. I do believe that 
      the world exhibits prodigies and beauties that, while they do not exceed 
      explanation, continually stretch my own feeble efforts at acknowledging 
      and explaining. And I feel, how to put this, what I would have to call a 
      spiritual joy in that excessiveness, in being so often stretched. It is 
      in this way, primarily, that I have delighted in the Americas.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">On 
      the long <font color="#804000">bus</font> from Cuidad Bolivar to Caracas 
      the next day, <font color="#804000">February 10</font>, the drivers won't 
      let me push aside the curtain to look forward. So, grumpily, I move to a 
      seat in the back. Everybody, everywhere else on this bus, it turns out, 
      is riding with their curtains closed. Well, here is a cultural difference 
      about which I am entirely intolerant. The whole bus a dark cave except for 
      the crack of light let in by the only foreigner. And at one point the driver 
      actually walks back and asks me to close my curtain. Why? Naps? The air-conditioning? 
      But I am prepared to make my stand here. I will not ride a bus if I can't 
      open the curtain, if I can't see. Even if the road is surrounded mostly 
      with scrub trees and brown and green grasses and high-tension wires, I will 
      be alert -- it is a cause, a mission -- to the world's wonders. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#804000">Caracas</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">, 
      at sunset is looking good to me, in part because the guidebooks presented 
      it as uninteresting. I ask at the hotel whether it is safe to walk out on 
      the nearby square. <font color="#804000">Safe</font> until eight p.m., I 
      am told. It is seven p.m. I walk out on the nearby square. And very early 
      the next morning catch a plane for a quick visit home.</font></b></p>
