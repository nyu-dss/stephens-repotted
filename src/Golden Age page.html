<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b><font size="+3" color="#808000">A 
  golden age for newspapers? </font> </b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">What happens to an established 
  form of communication when a new one starts taking over? This is an old question 
  for newspaper watchers, but I'm proposing a new answer: Often a golden age happens. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider movies in the 
  increasingly television-obsessed late sixties and early seventies. Many critics 
  now believe that was when filmmaking in America was most creative, most original. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Consider also what happened 
  to theater when print was moving in on England, say about the year 1600. Shakespeare 
  was among those content to toil away in that old, presumably outdated medium. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But newspapers? Today? 
  With their circulations on a seemingly endless decline? With cautious corporate 
  functionaries ensconced at the top of most mastheads? After all those stories 
  about Monica?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The case for a golden age 
  begins with the look of our papers. Those stuffy, gray ladies of yesteryear 
  now wear colors and look almost fashionable. Increasingly they are not just 
  laid out, but designed. And this makeover has not merely been cosmetic. It includes 
  more revealing illustrations, much better charts, more, and more thoughtful, 
  listings.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And, surprisingly, there’s 
  more news in most American papers now. Carl Stepp, writing in the American Journalism 
  Review, demonstrated this by counting column inches in newspapers thirty-five 
  years ago. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Stepp also concluded that 
  newspaper writing has gotten much better. This won’t seem so shocking if you’ve 
  had occasion recently to plow through the lengthy, fact-dense paragraphs that 
  squat atop most stories preserved on microfilm. No newspaper journalist today 
  may deserve comparison with Shakespeare – or even with Ernie Pyle – but most 
  do at least TRY to write more lucidly, more engagingly, more analytically.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And as for coverage… Well, 
  if you believe the news world begins and ends in city halls and state capitals 
  then this is certainly no golden age for you. Same if you miss the ideologically 
  charged days of the cold war. But those of us who think there’s also news in 
  corporations, hip hop, romance, migraines and migrations have never found so 
  much of interest in our dailies. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The explanation for this 
  apparent golden age? Competition with television and now the Internet is, happily, 
  forcing newspapers to do more, to be different, to do better. Movies thirty 
  years ago were inspired by a similar challenge from television. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Newspapers today are also 
  catering to increasingly elite, better-educated audiences. The less-educated, 
  unhappily, have been abandoning newspapers, mostly in favor of television, just 
  when there may be good reason to stay. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Not that it is possible 
  to pick up an American newspaper today without finding a couple of blown leads 
  or missed stories. I said golden age, not perfect age.</font></P>
