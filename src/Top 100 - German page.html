  &quot;the rise of the image the fall of the word,&quot; &quot;A History of News&quot;</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&nbsp;</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Top hundred&quot; 
  lists of all sorts had begun to pop up in this country before we decided to 
  work on our list: the top hundred English-language novels of the century, the 
  top hundred movies. But lists of favorite novels or movies are often compiled 
  – in dormitory rooms, at dinner parties. Journalism is not often discussed in 
  this way. Works of journalism are not often compared across decades. And some 
  of the best works of journalism – great investigative books, for example, or 
  dramatic magazine articles -- are not always placed under the heading of journalism. 
  We thought we had an opportunity to begin an important discussion of what makes 
  for excellence, enduring excellence, in journalism – at a time when journalism’s 
  failings receive most of the attention.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">From the moment we began 
  putting together the group of seventeen distinguished outside judges, who would 
  join with the faculty of the Department of Journalism and New York University 
  in selecting our list, there was little doubt about which work was most likely 
  to finish first. Most of us guessed it would be the exhaustively reported, finely 
  detailed and hauntingly understated account the accomplished reporter (and later 
  successful novelist) John Hersey produced on the consequences of the atomic 
  bomb dropped by the United States on the Japanese city Hiroshima. It is still 
  assigned reading in American high schools. Its effect on this country when it 
  was first published in 1946 was profound. &quot;This spare, uninflected, factual 
  account brought home to America the experience of nuclear war by telling the 
  stories of some of its victims,&quot; noted Robert Manoff, director of the Center 
  for War, Peace and the News Media at New York University. &quot;<I>The New Yorker</I> 
  magazine devoted a full issue to it, and it caused a sensation.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Hiroshima&quot; can 
  be said to be the founding document of the anti-nuclear movement. The second 
  item on our list, again no surprise, played a crucial role in launching the 
  environmental movement. The deleterious effects of pesticides such as DDT were 
  rarely discussed when in 1962 Rachel Carson, a nature writer, published, again 
  in The New Yorker, the articles that were collected in the book &quot;Silent 
  Spring.&quot; Journalists do not often change the way their readers think. Carson 
  helped many Americans realize that our spot-free apples and bug-free crops were 
  not without cost – to birds, animals, streams and humans.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Impact was clearly one 
  of the most important standards our judges used in selecting the 270 or so works 
  that were nominated for our list and then the final one hundred. Bob Woodward 
  and Carl Bernstein were two not particularly successful local reporters on the 
  Washington Post when they began covering what seemed a minor break-in at the 
  Watergate apartment complex in Washington in 1972. They stayed with the story. 
  By the time they were done they were probably the best-known journalists in 
  the country (played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the movie of their 
  book, &quot;All the President’s Men&quot;); the Washington Post had established 
  itself as the second most influential newspaper in the United States (after 
  the New York Times); and the country’s president, Richard Nixon, had been forced 
  to resign because of his efforts to cover-up his administration’s involvement 
  in that break-in. That’s impact. Would the cover-up have been discovered without 
  Woodward and Bernstein? Historians debate the point. But there is no debate 
  about the doggedness, insight and power of their reporting. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It took courage to take 
  on a president – courage on the part of those two reporters and their newspaper. 
  Courage was another of the qualities much valued by our judges.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Radio and television journalism 
  were not well represented on our list – an fair indication of their reputation 
  in America today. However, three of our top eleven works were by the revered 
  CBS radio and television correspondent Edward R. Murrow: His television documentary 
  exposing the conditions of migrant farm workers in the United States, &quot;Harvest 
  of Shame&quot; (1960) finished eleventh. Another television documentary, also 
  produced with Fred Friendly, courageously taking on the redbaiting senator, 
  Joseph McCarthy, (1954) was tenth. And Murrow’s unusually compelling radio news 
  reports during the bombing of London in 1940, which played a significant role 
  in alerting Americans to the Nazi threat, were judged our fourth best work of 
  the century.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In 1902 an issue of McClure’s 
  magazine featured the first installment of two major investigations. Together 
  these magazine series helped establish the golden age of &quot;muckraking,&quot; 
  or investigative reporting, in the United States. One, Ida Tarbell’s historical 
  investigation of the monopolistic practices of John Rockefeller’s Standard Oil 
  company, finished fifth on our list. The other, Lincoln Steffens’ series on 
  municipal corruption in the United States, finished sixth. Both played a major 
  role in the Progressive movement in the United States. Both led to major reforms 
  – in the oil business, in city government. Not enough reforms, Steffens argued.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Perhaps the most controversial 
  work on our list is the seventh, John Reed’s book,</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Ten 
  Days That Shook the World,&quot;</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
  reporting on the October revolution in Russia in 1917. Yes, as conservative 
  critics have noted, Reed was a partisan. Yes, historians would do better. But 
  this was probably the most consequential news story of the century, and Reed 
  was there, and Reed could write. The magnitude of the event being reported on 
  and the quality of the writing were other important standards in our considerations.</font></P>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Two of the country’s most 
  respected journalists finished eighth and ninth on our list: H. L. Mencken and 
  Ernie Pyle. Mencken – a hard-bitten, incisive critic with a remarkably wide 
  vocabulary – was honored for his devastating account of a legal challenge to 
  the teaching of evolution in the schools in 1925; Pyle for his emotional, detailed 
  and wonderfully human reports from Europe and the Pacific during World War II.</font> 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Again, exceptionally good 
  writers covering crucial stories. And one measure of Pyle’s courage is that 
  he was killed while reporting on a battle in the Pacific.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This list was never intended 
  as the last word on the subject. We realize that all such list have a degree 
  of arbitrariness. The comparisons upon which they are based are difficult, in 
  some sense impossible. However, our list has led to a lively debate on what 
  makes for quality in journalism. (For example: Can broadcast journalists today 
  produce work on this level? Is it necessary to crusade and take on the establishment 
  to produce great journalism?) This list has also inspired many students, journalists 
  and others to revisit work they may have missed. That is all we could have asked.</font></P>
