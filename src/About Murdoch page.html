<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> RUPERT MURDOCH'S likely return to control of the
  New York Post may be good for the newspaper's employees, but it is disturbing
  news for those of us who are concerned with keeping political debate in this
  city honest and fair. For Murdoch was more than the publisher who, with such
  headlines as "Headless Body in Topless Bar," began the current wave of tabloid
  sensationalism in New York City. He was, during his first run as the Post's
  owner, from 1977 to 1988, unscrupulous in his use of the paper's news columns
  to advance his political causes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> Almost all American daily newspapers today at least
  try to keep their editorial opinions from influencing their news coverage. It
  is a worthy effort, given how few newspapers are left for readers to turn to
  for news. The Post under Murdoch made no such effort. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> Here are some examples from studies I helped conduct:
  </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> During the month before the 1977 mayoral primary,
  the Post's early editions ran no unfavorable stories about Murdoch's candidate,
  Edward Koch, but many nasty stories about Koch's opponents, such as "The Blond
  Millionairess Whose Big Bucks Back Cuomo." The Post mentioned Koch favorably
  in four front-page headlines; the six other candidates were mentioned favorably
  on the front page a total of once. Koch received 32 inches of favorable coverage
  on pages 2 through 5, all the other candidates, including the incumbent, Mayor
  Abraham Beame, a total of 35 inches. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> In 1980, Murdoch's support of Ronald Reagan in his
  race for the presidency against Jimmy Carter spilled all over the Post's news
  columns, as was apparent in these headlines: "Reagan: I'll Save the Middle Class"
  - a scoop proclaimed in red ink on the front page. "Israel Fears Carter Victory"
  - the article referred to by this front-page headline included no quotes from
  any Israeli, named or unnamed, supporting the charge. "Stars Want Ron to Get
  the Part" - no stars supporting Carter were quoted. "Khomeini Pulls the Strings,"
  and then in smaller type, "Carter Back on Campaign Trail" - this intriguing
  pairing of thoughts was given two-thirds of the front page on the day before
  the election. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> On Jan. 25, 1982, a front-page headline in the Post
  - not, of course, labeled an editorial - proposed "Ed Koch for Governor." Koch
  had not entered the race and had not been included 10 days earlier in the newspaper's
  discussion of 11 possible candidates. But, after the paper invited readers to
  fill out a Koch for Governor coupon on its news pages every weekday for the
  next two weeks and ran news headlines such as "Apple Loves Koch," the then-mayor
  eventually entered the primary, which he went on to lose to Mario Cuomo. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> When other papers "endorse you, you get one column
  on the editorial page," groused Cuomo at the time. "With Rupert, he turns the
  whole paper over to you." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> Murdoch's flagrantly partisan style of journalism
  was common in the United States a hundred years ago. But then each city had
  many newspapers; they balanced each other's slants. New York now has only three
  other general-circulation dailies, and they attempt to honor the line between
  news coverage and opinion columns or editorials. If Murdoch returns, there will
  again be no one to balance his front-page crusades and assaults. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> That may be one reason so many politicians, including
  Cuomo, are trying to get on Murdoch's good side by helping in his bid to regain
  control of the Post. Because his support extended beyond the editorial page,
  Murdoch was for a time arguably the most powerful political force in the country's
  largest city. He may very well become that again. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> The problem, if Murdoch regains control, is that
  the city's newspaper readers, conditioned to expect a different kind of journalism,
  may not understand that many of the news stories they will be reading in the
  Post may not be the result of normal reporting but rather expressions of the
  publisher's personal political preferences. That would be unfortunate for them
  and for the political life of this city.</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"> </FONT></P>
